        MOON FACE</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Jack London</div>
      <p>John Claverhouse was a moon-faced man. You know the
        kind&#8212;cheek-bones wide apart, chin and forehead melting into the
        cheeks to complete the perfect round, and the nose, broad and pudgy,
        equidistant from the circumference, flattened against the very centre of
        the face like a dough-ball upon the ceiling. Perhaps that is why I hated
        him, for truly he had become an offense to my eyes, and I believed the
        earth to be cumbered with his presence. Perhaps my mother may have been
        superstitious of the moon and looked upon it over the wrong shoulder at
        the wrong time.</p>
      <p>But be that as it may, I hated John Claverhouse. Not that he had done
        me what society would consider a wrong or an ill turn. Far from it, in
        any such sense. The evil was of a deeper, subtler sort; so elusive, so
        intangible, as to defy clear, definite analysis in words. We all
        experience such things at some period in our lives. For the first time
        we see a certain individual, one whom the very instant before we did not
        dream existed; and yet, at the first moment of meeting, we say: “I do
        not like that man.” Why do we not like him? And we do not know why; we
        only know that we do not. We have taken a dislike, that is all. And so I
        with John Claverhouse. </p>
      <p>What right had such a man to be happy? Yet he was an optimist. He was
        always gleeful and laughing. All things were always all right, curse
        him! Ah! how it grated on my soul that he should be so happy! Other men
        could laugh, and it did not bother me. I even used to laugh
        myself&#8212;before I met John Claverhouse.</p>
      <p>But his laugh! It irritated me, maddened me, as nothing else under the
        sun could irritate or madden me. It haunted me, gripped hold of me, and
        would not let me go. It was a huge, Gargantuan laugh. Waking or sleeping
        it was always with me, whirring and jarring across my heart-strings and
        the very fibres of my being like an enormous rasp. At break of day it
        came whooping across the fields to spoil my pleasant morning reverie.
        Under the aching noon-day glare, when the green things drooped and the
        birds withdrew to the depths of the forest, and all nature drowsed, his
        great “Ha! ha!” and “Ho! ho!” rose up to the sky and challenged the sun.
        And at black midnight, from the lonely cross-roads where he turned from
        town into his own place, came his plaguy cachinnations to rouse me from
        my sleep and make me toss about and clench my nails into my palms.</p>
      <p>I went forth privily in the night-time and turned his cattle into his
        fields, and in the morning heard his whooping laugh as he drove them out
        again. “It is nothing,” he said; “the poor, dumb beasties are not to be
        blamed for straying into fatter pastures.”</p>
      <p>He had a dog he called “Mars,” a big, splendid brute, part deerhound
        and part bloodhound, and resembling both. Mars was a great delight to
        him, and they were always together. But I bided my time, and one day,
        when opportunity was ripe, lured the animal away and settled for him
        with arsenic and beefsteak. It made positively no impression on John
        Claverhouse. His laugh was as hearty and frequent as ever, and his face
        as much like the full moon as it always had been.</p>
      <p>Then I set fire to his hay-stacks and his barn. But the next morning,
        being Sunday, he went forth blithe and cheerful.</p>
      <p>“Where are you going?” I asked him, as he went by the cross-roads. </p>
      <p>“Trout,” he said, and his face beamed like a full moon. “I just dote on
        trout, you know.”</p>
      <p>Was there ever such an impossible man! His whole harvest had gone up in
        his hay-stacks and barn. It was uninsured, I knew. And yet, in the face
        of famine and the rigorous winter, he went out gayly in quest of a mess
        of trout, forsooth, because he “doted” on them! Had gloom but rested, no
        matter how lightly, on his brow, or had his bovine countenance grown
        long and serious and less like the moon, or had he removed that smile
        but once from off his face, I am sure I could have forgiven him for
        existing. But, no, he grew only more cheerful under misfortune.</p>
      <p>I insulted him. He looked at me in slow and smiling surprise.</p>
      <p>“I fight you? Why?” he asked, slowly. And then he laughed. “You are so
        funny! Ho! ho! You’ll be the death of me! He! he! he! Oh! Ho! ho! ho!”
      </p>
      <p>What would you? It was past endurance. By the blood of Judas, how I
        hated him! Then there was that name&#8212;Claverhouse! What a name!
        Wasn’t it absurd? Claverhouse! Merciful heaven, <i>why</i> Claverhouse?
        Again and again I asked myself that question. I should not have minded
        Smith, or Brown, or Jones&#8212;but <i>Claverhouse</i>! I leave it to
        you. Repeat it to yourself&#8212;Claverhouse. Just listen to the
        ridiculous sound of it&#8212;Claverhouse! Should a man live with such a
        name? I ask of you. “No,” you say. And “No” said I. </p>
      <p>But I bethought me of his mortgage. What of his crops and barn
        destroyed, I knew he would be unable to meet it. So I got a shrewd,
        close-mouthed, tight-fisted money-lender to get the mortgage transferred
        to him. I did not appear, but through this agent I forced the
        foreclosure, and but few days (no more, believe me, than the law
        allowed) were given John Claverhouse to remove his goods and chattels
        from the premises. Then I strolled down to see how he took it, for he
        had lived there upward of twenty years. But he met me with his
        saucer-eyes twinkling, and the light glowing and spreading in his face
        till it was as a full-risen moon.</p>
      <p>“Ha! ha! ha!” he laughed. “The funniest tike, that youngster of mine!
        Did you ever hear the like? Let me tell you. He was down playing by the
        edge of the river when a piece of the bank caved in and splashed him.
        ‘Oh, papa!’ he cried; ‘a great big puddle flewed up and hit me.’”</p>
      <p>He stopped and waited for me to join him in his infernal glee.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see any laugh in it,” I said, shortly, and I know my face went
        sour.</p>
      <p>He regarded me with wonderment, and then came the damnable light,
        glowing and spreading, as I have described it, till his face shone soft
        and warm, like the summer moon, and then the laugh&#8212;“Ha! ha! That’s
        funny! You don’t see it, eh? He! he! Ho! ho! ho! He doesn’t see it! Why,
        look here. You know, a puddle&#8212;&#8212;” </p>
      <p>But I turned on my heel and left him. That was the last. I could stand
        it no longer. The thing must end right there, I thought, curse him! The
        earth should be quit of him. And as I went over the hill, I could hear
        his monstrous laugh reverberating against the sky.</p>
      <p>Now, I pride myself on doing things neatly, and when I resolved to kill
        John Claverhouse I had it in mind to do so in such a fashion that I
        should not look back upon it and feel ashamed. I hate bungling, and I
        hate brutality. To me there is something repugnant in merely striking a
        man with one’s naked fist&#8212;faugh! it is sickening! So, to shoot, or
        stab, or club John Claverhouse (O that name!) did not appeal to me. And
        not only was I impelled to do it neatly and artistically, but also in
        such manner that not the slightest possible suspicion could be directed
        against me.</p>
      <p>To this end I bent my intellect, and, after a week of profound and
        strenuous incubation, I hatched the scheme. Then I set to work. I bought
        a water-spaniel bitch, five months old, and devoted my whole attention
        to her training. Had any one spied upon me, they would have remarked
        that this training consisted entirely of one
        thing&#8212;<i>retrieving</i>. I taught the dog, which I called
        “Bellona,” to fetch sticks I threw into the water, and not only to
        fetch, but to fetch at once, without mouthing or playing with them. The
        point was that she was to stop for nothing, but to deliver the stick in
        all haste. I made a practice of running away and leaving her to chase
        me, with the stick in her mouth, till she caught me. She was a bright
        animal, and took to the game with such eagerness that I was soon
        content.</p>
      <p>After that, at the first casual opportunity, I presented Bellona to
        John Claverhouse. I knew what I was about, for I was aware of a little
        weakness of his, and of a little private and civic sinning of which he
        was regularly and inveterately guilty.</p>
      <p>“No,” he said, when I placed the end of the rope to which she was tied
        in his hand. “No, you don’t mean it.” And his mouth opened wide, and he
        grinned all over his damnable moon-face.</p>
      <p>“I&#8212;I kind of thought, somehow, you didn’t like me,” he explained.
        “Wasn’t it funny for me to make such a mistake?” And at the thought he
        held his sides with laughter.</p>
      <p>“What is her name?” he managed to ask between paroxysms.</p>
      <p>“Bellona,” I said.</p>
      <p>“He! he!” he tittered. “What a funny name!”</p>
      <p>I gritted my teeth, for his mirth put them on edge, and snapped out
        between them: “She was the wife of Mars, you know.”</p>
      <p>Then the light of the full moon began to suffuse his face, until he
        exploded with: “Well, I guess she’s a widow now! Oh! Ho! ho! E! he! he!
        Ho!” he whooped after me, and I turned and fled swiftly away over the
        hill.</p>
      <p>The week passed by, and on Saturday evening I said to him: “You go away
        Monday, don’t you?”</p>
      <p>He nodded his head and grinned.</p>
      <p>“Then you won’t have another chance to get a mess of those trout you
        just ‘dote’ on.”</p>
      <p>But he did not notice the sneer. “Oh, I don’t know,” he chuckled. “I’m
        going up to-morrow to try pretty hard.”</p>
      <p>Thus was assurance made doubly sure, and I went back to my house
        literally hugging myself with rapture.</p>
      <p>Early next morning I saw him go by with a dip-net and gunnysack, and
        Bellona trotting at his heels. I knew where he was bound, and cut out by
        the back pasture and climbed through the underbrush to the top of the
        mountain. Keeping carefully out of sight, I followed the crest along for
        a couple of miles to a natural amphitheatre in the hills, where the
        little river ramped down out of a gorge, and stopped for breath in a
        large and placid rock-bound pool. That was the spot! I sat down on the
        croup of the mountain, where I could see all that occurred, and lighted
        my pipe.</p>
      <p>Ere many minutes had passed, John Claverhouse came plodding up the bed
        of the stream. Bellona was ambling about him, and they were in high
        feather, her short, snappy barks mingling with his deeper chest-notes.
        Arrived at the pool, he threw down the dip-net and sack, and drew from
        his hip-pocket what looked like a large, fat candle. But I knew it to be
        a stick of “giant”; for such was his method of catching trout. He
        dynamited them. He attached the fuse by wrapping the “giant” tightly in
        a piece of cotton. Then he ignited the fuse and tossed the explosive
        into the pool.</p>
      <p>Like a flash, Bellona was into the pool after it. I could have shrieked
        aloud for very joy. Claverhouse yelled at her, but without avail. He
        pelted her with clods and rocks, but she swam steadily on till she got
        the stick of “giant” in her mouth, when she whirled about and headed for
        shore. Then, for the first time, he realized his danger, and started to
        run. As foreseen and planned by me, she made the bank and took out after
        him. Oh, I tell you, it was great! As I have said, the pool lay in a
        sort of amphitheatre. Above and below, the stream could be crossed on
        stepping-stones. And around and around, up and down and across the
        stones, raced Claverhouse and Bellona. I could never have believed that
        such an ungainly man could run so fast. But run he did, Bellona
        hot-footed after him, and gaining. And then, just as she caught up, he
        in full stride, and she leaping with nose at his knee, there was a
        sudden flash, a burst of smoke, and terrific detonation, and where man
        and dog had been the instant before there was naught to be seen but a
        big hole in the ground.</p>
      <p>“Death from accident while engaged in illegal fishing.” That was the
        verdict of the coroner’s jury; and that is why I pride myself on the
        neat and artistic way in which I finished off John Claverhouse. There
        was no bungling, no brutality; nothing to be ashamed of in the whole
        transaction, as I am sure you will agree. No more does his infernal
        laugh go echoing among the hills, and no more does his fat moon-face
        rise up to vex me. My days are peaceful now, and my night’s sleep deep.

        A CAGED LION</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Frank Norris</div>
      <p>In front of the entrance a “spieler” stood on a starch-box and beat
        upon a piece of tin with a stick, and we weakly succumbed to his
        frenzied appeals and went inside. We did this, I am sure, partly to
        please the “spieler,” who would have been dreadfully disappointed if we
        had not done so, but partly, too, to please Toppan, who was always
        interested in the great beasts and liked to watch them.</p>
      <p>It is possible that you may remember Toppan as the man who married
        Victoria Boyden, and, in so doing, thrust his greatness from him and
        became a bank-clerk instead of an explorer. After he married, he came to
        be quite ashamed of what he had done in Thibet and Africa and other
        unknown corners of the earth, and, after a while, very seldom spoke of
        that part of his life at all; or, when he did, it was only to allude to
        it as a passing boyish fancy, altogether foolish and silly, like
        calf-love and early attempts at poetry.</p>
      <p>“I used to think I was going to set the world on fire at one time,” he
        said once; “I suppose every young fellow has some such ideas. I only
        made an ass of myself, and I’m glad I’m well out of it. Victoria saved
        me from that.” </p>
      <p>But this was long afterward. He died hard, and sometimes he would have
        moments of strength in his weakness, just as before he had given up his
        career during a moment of weakness in his strength. During the first
        years after he had given up his career, he thought he was content with
        the way things had come to be; but it was not so, and now and then the
        old feeling, the love of the old life, the old ambition, would be
        stirred into activity again by some sight, or sound, or episode in the
        conventional life around him. A chance paragraph in a newspaper, a sight
        of the Arizona deserts of sage and cactus, a momentary panic on a
        ferry-boat, sometimes even fine music or a great poem would wake the
        better part of him to the desire of doing great things. At such times
        the longing grew big and troublous within him to cut loose from it all,
        and get back to those places of the earth where there were neither
        months nor years, and where the days of the week had no names; where he
        could feel unknown winds blowing against his face and unnamed mountains
        rising beneath his feet; where he could see great sandy, stony stretches
        of desert with hot, blue shadows, and plains of salt, and thickets of
        jungle-grass, broken only by the lairs of beasts and the paths the
        steinbok make when they go down to water.</p>
      <p>The most trifling thing would recall all this to him just as a couple
        of notes have recalled to you whole arias and overtures. But with Toppan
        it was as though one had recalled the arias and the overtures, and then
        was not allowed to sing them.</p>
      <p>We went into the arena and sat down. The ring in the middle was fenced
        in by a great, circular iron cage. The tiers of seats rose around this,
        a band was playing in a box over the entrance, and the whole interior
        was lighted by an electric globe slung over the middle of the cage.
        Inside a brown bear&#8212;to me less suggestive of a wild animal than of
        lap-robes and furriers’ signs&#8212;was dancing sleepily and allowing
        himself to be prodded by a person whose celluloid standing-collar showed
        white at the neck above the green of his Tyrolese costume. The bear was
        mangy, and his steel muzzle had chafed him, and Toppan said he was
        corrupted of moth and rust alike, and the audience applauded but feebly
        when he and his keeper withdrew.</p>
      <p>After this we had a clown-elephant, dressed in a bib and tucker and
        vast baggy breeches&#8212;like those of a particularly big French
        <i>Turco</i>&#8212;who had lunch with his keeper, and rang the bell and
        drank his wine and wiped his mouth with a handkerchief like a bed-quilt,
        and pulled the chair from underneath his companion, seeming to be amused
        at it all with a strange sort of suppressed elephantine mirth.</p>
      <p>And then, after they had both made their bow and gone out, in bounded
        and tumbled the dogs, barking and grinning all over, jumping up on their
        stools and benches, wriggling and pushing one another about, giggling
        and excited like so many kindergarten children on a show day. I am sure
        they enjoyed their performance as much as the audience did, for they
        never had to be told what to do, and seemed only too eager for their
        turn to come. The best of it all was that they were quite unconscious of
        the audience, and appeared to do their tricks for the sake of the tricks
        themselves, and not for the applause which followed them. And, then,
        after the usual programme of wicker cylinders, hoops, and balls was
        over, they all rushed off amid a furious scrattling of paws and
        filliping of tails and heels. </p>
      <p>While this was going on, we had been hearing from time to time a great
        sound, half-whine, half-rumbling guttural cough, that came from
        somewhere behind the exit from the cage. It was repeated at rapidly
        decreasing intervals, and grew lower in pitch until it ended in a short
        bass grunt. It sounded cruel and menacing, and when at its full volume
        the wood of the benches under us thrilled and vibrated.</p>
      <p>There was a little pause in the programme while the arena was cleared
        and new and much larger and heavier paraphernalia were set about, and a
        gentleman with well-groomed hair and a very shiny hat entered and
        announced “the world’s greatest lion-tamer.” Then he went away and the
        tamer came in and stood expectantly by the side of the entrance. There
        was another short wait and the band struck a long minor chord.</p>
      <p>And then they came in, one after the other, with long, crouching,
        lurching strides, not all good-humoredly, like the dogs or the elephant,
        or even the bear, but with low-hanging heads, surly, watchful, their
        eyes gleaming with the rage and hate that burned in their hearts, and
        that they dared not vent. Their loose, yellow hides rolled and rippled
        over the great muscles as they moved, and the breath coming from their
        hot, half-open mouths turned to steam as it struck the air. </p>
      <p>A huge, blue-painted see-saw was dragged out to the centre, and the
        tamer made a sharp sound of command. Slowly, and with twitching tails,
        two of them obeyed, and, clambering upon the balancing-board, swung up
        and down, while the music played a see-saw waltz. And all the while
        their great eyes flamed with the detestation of the thing, and their
        black upper lips curled away from their long fangs in protest of this
        hourly renewed humiliation and degradation.</p>
      <p>And one of the others, while waiting his turn to be whipped and
        bullied, sat up on his haunches and faced us and looked far away beyond
        us over the heads of the audience&#8212;over the continent and ocean, as
        it were&#8212;as though he saw something in that quarter that made him
        forget his present surroundings.</p>
      <p>“You grand old brute,” muttered Toppan; and then he said: “Do you know
        what you would see if you were to look into his eyes now? You would see
        Africa, and unnamed mountains, and great stony stretches of desert, with
        hot blue shadows, and plains of salt, and lairs in the jungle-grass, and
        lurking places near the paths the steinbok make when they go down to
        water. But now he’s hampered and caged&#8212;<i>is</i> there anything
        worse than a caged lion?&#8212;and kept from the life he loves and was
        made for”&#8212;just here the tamer spoke sharply to him, and his eyes
        and crest drooped&#8212;“and ruled over,” concluded Toppan, “by some one
        who is not so great as he, who has spoiled what was best in him, and has
        turned his powers to trivial, resultless uses&#8212;some one weaker than
        he, yet stronger. Ah, well, old brute, it was yours once, we will
        remember that.”</p>
      <p>They wheeled out a clumsy velocipede built expressly for him, and,
        while the lash whistled and snapped about him, the conquered king heaved
        himself upon it and went around and around the ring, while the band
        played a quickstep. The audience broke into applause, and the tamer
        smirked and bobbed his well-oiled head. I thought of Samson performing
        for the Philistines and Thusnelda at the triumph of Germanicus. The
        great beasts, grand though conquered, seemed to be the only dignified
        ones in the whole business. I hated the audience who saw their shame
        from behind iron bars; I hated myself for being one of them; and I hated
        the smug, sniggering tamer. </p>
      <p>This latter had been drawing out various stools and ladders, and now
        arranged the lions upon them so they should form a pyramid, with himself
        on top.</p>
      <p>Then he swung himself up among them, with his heels upon their necks,
        and, taking hold of the jaws of one, wrenched them apart with a great
        show of strength, turning his head to the audience so that all should
        see.</p>
      <p>And just then the electric light above him cackled harshly, guttered,
        dropped down to a pencil of dull red, then went out, and the place was
        absolutely dark.</p>
      <p>The band stopped abruptly, with a discord, and there was an instant of
        silence. Then we heard the stools and ladders clattering as the lions
        leaped down; and straightway four pair of lambent green spots burned out
        of the darkness and traveled swiftly about here and there, crossing and
        recrossing one another like the lights of steamers in a storm.
        Heretofore, the lions had been sluggish and inert; now they were aroused
        and alert in an instant, and we could hear the swift <i>pad-pad</i> of
        their heavy feet as they swung around the arena, and the sound of their
        great bodies rubbing against the bars of the cage as one and the other
        passed nearer to us. </p>
      <p>I don’t think the audience at all appreciated the situation at first,
        for no one moved or seemed excited, and one shrill voice suggested that
        the band should play “When the Electric Lights Go Out.”</p>
      <p>“Keep perfectly quiet, please!” called the tamer out of the darkness,
        and a certain peculiar ring in his voice was the first intimation of a
        possible danger.</p>
      <p>But Toppan knew; and as we heard the tamer fumbling for the catch of
        the gate, which he somehow could not loose in the darkness, he said,
        with a rising voice: “He wants to get that gate open pretty quick.”</p>
      <p>But for their restless movements the lions were quiet; they uttered no
        sound, which was a bad sign. Blinking and dazed by the garish
        blue-whiteness of a few moments before, they could see perfectly now
        where the tamer was blind.</p>
      <p>“Listen,” said Toppan. Near to us, and on the inside of the cage, we
        could hear a sound as of some slender body being whisked back and forth
        over the surface of the floor. In an instant I guessed what it was; one
        of the lions was crouched there, whipping his sides with his tail.</p>
      <p>“When he stops that, he’ll spring,” said Toppan, excitedly.</p>
      <p>“Bring a light, Jerry&#8212;quick!” came the tamer’s voice.</p>
      <p>People were clambering to their feet by this time, talking loud, and we
        heard a woman cry out.</p>
      <p>“Please keep as quiet as possible, ladies and gentlemen!” cried the
        tamer; “it won’t do to excite&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>From the direction of the voice came the sound of a heavy fall and a
        crash that shook the iron gratings in their sockets.</p>
      <p>“He’s got him!” shouted Toppan.</p>
      <p>And then what a scene! In that thick darkness every one sprang up,
        stumbling over the seats and over each other, all shouting and crying
        out, suddenly stricken with a panic fear of something they could not
        see. Inside the barred death-trap every lion suddenly gave tongue at
        once, until the air shook and sang in our ears. We could hear the great
        cats hurling themselves against the bars, and could see their eyes
        leaving brassy streaks against the darkness as they leaped. Two more
        sprang, as the first had done, toward that quarter of the cage from
        which came sounds of stamping and struggling, and then the tamer began
        to scream.</p>
      <p>I think that so long as I shall live I shall not forget the sound of
        the tamer’s screams. He did not scream as a woman would have done, from
        the head, but from the chest, which sounded so much worse that I was
        sick from it in a second with that sickness that weakens one at the pit
        of the stomach and along the muscles at the back of the legs. He did not
        pause for a second. Every breath was a scream, and every scream was
        alike, and one heard through it all the long snarls of satisfied hate
        and revenge, muffled by the man’s clothes and the <i>rip</i>, <i>rip</i>
        of the cruel, blunt claws.</p>
      <p>Hearing it all in the dark, as we did, made it all the more dreadful. I
        think for a time I must have taken leave of my senses. I was ready to
        vomit for the sickness that was upon me, and I beat my hands raw upon
        the iron bars or clasped them over my ears against the sounds of the
        dreadful thing that was doing behind them. I remember praying aloud that
        it might soon be over with, so only those screams might be stopped.</p>
      <p>It seemed as though it had gone on for hours, when some men rushed in
        with a lantern and long, sharp irons. A hundred voices cried: “Here he
        is, over here!” and they ran around outside the cage and threw the light
        of the lantern on a place where a heap of gray, gold-laced clothes
        writhed and twisted beneath three great bulks of fulvous hide and
        bristling black mane. </p>
      <p>The irons were useless. The three furies dragged their prey out of
        their reach and crouched over it again and recommenced. No one dared to
        go into the cage, and still the man lived and struggled and screamed.
      </p>
      <p>I saw Toppan’s fingers go to his mouth, and through that medley of
        dreadful noises there issued a sound that, sick as I was, made me shrink
        anew and close my eyes and teeth and shudder as though some cold slime
        had been poured through the hollow of my bones where the marrow should
        be. It was as the noise of the whistling of a fine whip-lash, mingled
        with the whirr of a locust magnified a hundred times, and ended in an
        abrupt clacking noise thrice repeated.</p>
      <p>At once I remembered where I had heard it before, because, having once
        heard the hiss of an aroused and angry serpent, no child of Eve can ever
        forget it.</p>
      <p>The sound that now came from between Toppan’s teeth and that filled the
        arena from wall to wall, was the sound that I had heard once before in
        the Paris Jardin des Plantes at feeding-time&#8212;the sound made by the
        great constrictors, when their huge bodies are looped and coiled like a
        <i>reata</i> for the throw that never misses, that never relaxes, and
        that no beast of the field is built strong enough to withstand. All the
        filthy wickedness and abominable malice of the centuries since the Enemy
        first entered into that shape that crawls was concentrated in that
        hoarse, whistling hiss&#8212;a hiss that was cold and piercing, like an
        icicle-made sound. It was not loud, but had in it some sort of
        penetrating quality that cut through the waves of horrid sounds about
        us, as the snake-carved prow of a Viking galley might have cut its way
        through the tumbling eddies of a tide-rip.</p>
      <p>At the second repetition the lions paused. None better than they knew
        what was the meaning of that hiss. They had heard it before in their
        native hunting-grounds in the earlier days of summer, when the first
        heat lay close over all the jungle like the hollow of the palm of an
        angry god. Or if they themselves had not heard it, their sires before
        them had, and the fear of the thing bred into their bones suddenly
        leaped to life at the sound and gripped them and held them close.</p>
      <p>When for a third time the sound sung and shrilled in their ears, their
        heads drew between their shoulders, their great eyes grew small and
        glittering, the hackles rose and stiffened on their backs, their tails
        drooped, and they backed slowly to the further side of the cage and
        cowered there, whining and beaten.</p>
      <p>Toppan wiped the sweat from the inside of his hands and went into the
        cage with the keepers and gathered up the panting, broken body, with its
        twitching fingers and dead, white face and ears, and carried it out. As
        they lifted it, the handful of pitiful medals dropped from the shredded,
        gray coat and rattled down upon the floor. In the silence that had now
        succeeded, it was about the only sound one heard.</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>As we sat that evening on the porch of Toppan’s house, in a fashionable
        suburb of the city, he said, for the third time: “I had that trick from
        a Mpongwee headman,” and added: “It was while I was at Victoria Falls,
        waiting to cross the Kalahari Desert.”</p>
      <p>Then he continued, his eyes growing keener and his manner changing:
        “There is some interesting work to be done in that quarter by some one.
        You see, the Kalahari runs like this”&#8212;he drew the lines on the
        ground with his cane&#8212;“coming down in something like this shape
        from the Orange River to about the twentieth parallel south. The aneroid
        gives its average elevation about six hundred feet. I didn’t cross it at
        the time, because we had sickness and the porters cut. But I made a lot
        of geological observations, and from these I have built up a theory that
        the Kalahari is no desert at all, but a big, well-watered plateau, with
        higher ground to the east and west. The tribes, too, thereabout call the
        place ‘Linoka-Noka’ and that’s the Bantu for rivers upon rivers. They’re
        nasty, though, these Bantu, and gave us a lot of trouble. They have a
        way of spitting little poisoned thorns into you unawares, and your
        tongue swells up and turns blue and your teeth fall out
        and&#8212;&#8212;” </p>
      <p>His wife Victoria came out on the porch in evening-dress.</p>
      <p>“Ah, Vic,” said Toppan, jumping up, with a very sweet smile, “we were
        just talking about your paper-german next Tuesday, and <i>I</i> think we
        might have some very pretty favors made out of white
        tissue-paper&#8212;roses and butterflies, you know.”</p>

      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Gwendolen Overton</div>
      <p>The whistle of the steamer saluted three times&#8212;twice short and
        once long&#8212;the sun which rose over the deep green mountains of
        Costa Rica. The signal was answered in due time. A small tug put off
        from the long iron pier. There was a launch at the end of its tow line,
        a big, flat scow of a lighter. It came out across the smooth
        mother-of-pearl stretch of water, jerking and bobbing over the great
        Pacific swells. The tug shot by the steamer, the launch threw loose the
        tow line, and as it came alongside the forward cargo hatchway, a
        <i>lanchero</i> pitched another rope up to the boatswain.</p>
      <p>There followed delay. There must of necessity follow delay when the
        crews and captains of launches are West Coast natives&#8212;Mexican
        stevedores at the very best&#8212;and most of the sailors on the
        steamers the same. The first-officer, down on the main deck, gave
        orders, there was a creaking of hawsers on the strain, the rattle and
        squeal of blocks and tackle, and the rumble of moving freight in one of
        the forward cargo-spaces. The captain, immaculate in ducks, came out
        from his cabin. He went to the rail and looked over at La Libertad,
        where the white and red of its long, low houses showed clear in the
        daybreak among the glistening palms. Then he looked down. There were
        eight or ten <i>lancheros</i> in the lighter helping to confuse the very
        simple process of making her fast, or perched upon the gunwale observing
        with the vague placidity of their kind.</p>
      <p>The captain had no opinion of Central American natives of any sort,
        much less of <i>lancheros</i>. He considered these ones with rather more
        than usual disgust.</p>
      <p>“What’s the matter with them fellows in that launch, Marsden,” he
        inquired of the first-officer.</p>
      <p>Marsden was peering down into the black hole of the hold. He drew away
        and looked up to the rail of the hurricane deck. “Played out, sir,” he
        told him; “they were loading the <i>San Benito</i> until she put out
        last night at eleven.”</p>
      <p>The captain had no sympathy for them on that, or any other score. His
        eye was without mercy, as he took stock of them again. “Hullo&#8212;one
        of them is white,” he said. It was meant, as before, for the
        first-officer, but it was entirely audible to the <i>lancheros</i>.</p>
      <p>The first-officer looked over into the launch, and the man who was
        white looked up at him. Then the first-officer turned away. “Yes, sir,”
        he said. </p>
      <p>He walked to the hatchway edge. “Quartermaster,” he called. A voice
        from the hold answered him. “Send up those boxes of nails first,” he
        ordered.</p>
      <p>There followed a banging in the cargo-space, the boatswain’s whistle
        began its shrill little calls, which would keep up all day, a donkey
        engine puffed, and a windlass rattled in the bowels of the ship; the big
        hook on the end of its rope swung down the hatchway, and presently a
        net-sling full of boxes was hoisted and deposited on the main deck.</p>
      <p>“T. S. &amp; Co., over X, one&#8212;Garcia, three times&#8212;Y in a
        diamond, two times&#8212;J. S. &amp; Co., over X, four.” The first-officer
        marked the boxes with his chalk as he called their address and number,
        the checky for the port authorities and the freight-clerk for the ship
        kept tally and record in their own books; the net drew taut again at the
        boatswain’s whistle, and the first load of cargo swung overside and was
        lowered into the launch.</p>
      <p>The first-officer went to the side and watched it. It was the white man
        who unhooked the sling, who spilled out the boxes, and sent the sling
        back empty, all with a promptness that no native <i>lancheros</i> could
        have hoped, or would have dreamed of, attempting to attain. These looked
        rather more than usually dead and alive. Nominally, he was not the
        <i>capitan</i> of the launch, but it was clear that he was the
        self-constituted boss of it. The captain of the steamer said as
        much&#8212;“Must make their heads swim, that fellow.”</p>
      <p>The mate answered “Yes, sir,” again; but another net full of boxes was
        coming up. He went back to them. “J. S. &amp; Co. over X, two times&#8212;Y
        in a diamond, one,” he called. The checky and the freight-clerk
        registered; and the work of the day was well under way.</p>
      <p>But in spite of the one white man in the launch below it did not go
        with the speed the mate would have desired. The crew of the alternating
        launch was demoralized and worthless to the last degree. “Half
        dead&#8212;and it’s a <i>fiesta</i> besides, so they’re half drunk,
        too,” he remarked upon it to the captain. He pushed his cap back with
        the visor on his crown, and ran across his wet forehead the sleeve of a
        coat which had begun the day white. It was two o’clock of an October
        afternoon, and the heat was one of these things the fullness whereof can
        only be realized from having been experienced, which mere imagination is
        powerless to present.</p>
      <p>The <i>lancheros</i> were fumbling aimlessly at a load of steel rails.
        There was no white man in this lighter, and the management of it showed
        as much. Three rails were swung clashing together down on some crates
        that smashed like match-boxes under them. The mate raised his shoulders.
        It was not his business&#8212;so long as the breakage was not done on
        the ship, he was not accountable for it. Checky and the <i>capitan</i>
        of the “lanch” could settle that on shore.</p>
      <p>“What’s in those crates?” the captain inquired.</p>
      <p>“Merchandise&#8212;breakable,” answered the first-officer, cheerfully.
      </p>
      <p>“Brutes,” commented the captain. He gave expression to his views on
        black-and-tan <i>lancheros</i> in general.</p>
      <p>The mate nodded. He bent over the hatchway. “Quartermaster,” he called,
        “send up somebody with a marlinspike to mend this sling.” Then he went
        over and looked down into the launch. “<i>Despacio abajo</i>, hurry
        up&#8212;eh?” he shouted by way of suggestion to four <i>lancheros</i>
        who were pulling two ways on every rail, and had managed to drop into
        the water a rope sling, which it was affording them much concern and
        confusion, and the others much chattering and amusement, to fish out
        again.</p>
      <p>Marsden did not appear to be in a communicative mood, but the captain
        was oblivious to moods after the manner of the insistently good-humored
        and talkative.</p>
      <p>“It must be infernally unpleasant for that white fellow to work with
        the dogs,” he opined.</p>
      <p>“I expect so,” said Marsden. It was not a tone encouraging a pursuance
        of the subject. But the captain did not know it.</p>
      <p>“The <i>capitan</i> won’t stand his bossing some time,” he kept it up;
        “there’ll be a row, and the whole crew’ll take only too much pleasure in
        sticking their knives into him. He looks steady. Must be in a pretty bad
        way to come to that. Don’t know that I ever saw a white man in the fix
        along here before. He’d better get out of it while his skin’s whole.”
      </p>
      <p>“Wonder who he is?” he asked, presently. It was in the nature of an
        inquiry addressed to no one in general, and the mate in particular. The
        mate did not answer. He was concerning himself about a delay in the
        hold, and called down some orders which were superfluous, in view of the
        fact that the boatswain had just gone scuttling down the ladder to
        attend to things himself.</p>
      <p>The captain, however, was not put off. He had nothing to do. “Do you
        know?” he asked, when the mate came below him again.</p>
      <p>“Know what, sir?” Marsden was thinking his own thoughts. He had not
        paid much attention.</p>
      <p>“Who that fellow is?”</p>
      <p>“Man named Stanwood,” said the first-officer, and he tried to head the
        captain off by another order to the hold. It was accompanied by
        profanity. The delay was nobody’s fault, but, as is frequently the case,
        the oaths expended in one direction were inspired from another.</p>
      <p>It was a pity the captain couldn’t go aft and work a reckoning, or talk
        to the passengers. Not that he objected to the captain. The captain was
        a very good sort. It was the topic Marsden disliked.</p>
      <p>“Stanwood&#8212;rather imposing for a <i>lanchero</i> in there with all
        them black brutes, aint it? Not that he’s any cleaner, though. Who told
        you it was that?”</p>
      <p>“Nobody,” said Marsden; “I know it.”</p>
      <p>It broke in upon the captain then that he was being discouraged. “Oh!”
        he said. There followed a pause. “You’d better have a new rope through
        that block there when you’re ready to hoist those iron chimney stacks.”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes, sir,” answered the mate. The captain strolled off to the
        quarter-deck to watch the second-steward fishing for sharks.</p>
      <p>But time was not hanging heavy on Marsden’s hands. There was a look of
        bad weather, and if they were to get off that night, as might prove
        highly desirable, there had got to be a lot more hustling than the
        <i>lancheros</i> seemed capable of. </p>
      <p>The launch alongside had about all it could carry, and its
        <i>capitan</i> was calling for the tug, the soft, mournful note of his
        conch shell floating over the water to the shore. Marsden, by way of
        losing no time himself, ran up to the hurricane-deck and on to the
        bridge, and the whistle screeched across the blue-green of the sea,
        glinting in the sun, across the little port among its palms, and beyond
        through the lush jungle of the piling mountains, where the trees and
        vines and undergrowth matted in the moist, breathless temperature of a
        green-house. There were black clouds piling up behind the mountains, and
        rolling low into the great cañons and clefts of palm and fern trees.
        Marsden eyed them as he went below again.</p>
      <p>The launch alongside was loaded and sent adrift, to be picked up by the
        tug and towed back to the wharf. The tug was bringing out the other
        one&#8212;the one in which Stanwood was of the crew. Marsden wished that
        he were not. A man may have been your enemy. He may have brought about
        your finish. You may have thought for years that nothing could be too
        bad for him. But all the same&#8212;if he is a white man, one of your
        own kind, be he never so much of a scoundrel, it is not good to see him
        working among Central American <i>lancheros</i>, under a <i>capitan</i>
        of the same breed. It is a trifle too low. He is one of your own race,
        after all, and it hits you through the race.</p>
      <p>Marsden stood considering, keeping his balance as the ship rolled, at
        an angle of forty-five degrees to the line of the deck, backward or
        forward, according as she went to weather or to lee. It would have taken
        quite all the attention of a landsman to manage the feat at any effort,
        and with that he would probably have gone upon his skull or his nose.
        But Marsden was not even thinking about it. He was thinking of the time
        that Stanwood had bribed a Guatemala high official&#8212;with money
        already a long way from clean&#8212;and had thereby established in that
        misgoverned little country his altogether baseless claim to Marsden’s
        own sugar <i>finca</i> and refinery. It was the kind of thing that can
        be, and is constantly being, done south of twenty-three. And all your
        American citizenship can not avail to save you; rather, in fact, the
        other way&#8212;one of the mishaps of which you take your chance when
        you go to those countries to make a fortune, away from the hustle of
        colder climes. But it had been a blackguardly trick, nevertheless. And
        it had done for Marsden financially for good and all. He had thought
        himself in luck afterward to get the opportunity to ship to San
        Francisco on a P. M. steamer as a hand. He had been down to his last
        <i>real</i> then.</p>
      <p>It had done for him in other ways, too. Even now that he had got his
        master’s license, and worked up by quick stages to
        first-mate&#8212;well&#8212;his people on the other side of the
        continent lived a different sort of life, went in for another and more
        conventional style of thing. So did the people of the girl he had meant
        to make mistress of his beautiful sugar plantation. He had been in love
        with her since his school-days at home&#8212;pretty much ever since he
        could remember, so far as that went. But it had obviously been out of
        the question to expect her to marry a deck-hand. He had stopped writing
        to her before long. It had been better for her. As for himself&#8212;it
        didn’t matter much. His own life was very thoroughly spoiled, anyway.
        And the girl had married&#8212;a man of her own sort, which he himself
        had ceased to be.</p>
      <p>He owed all that to Stanwood. He owed a good deal to Stanwood. He had
        always intended to pay it some day, too&#8212;at the first chance that
        should present itself. Was this the chance? Perhaps.</p>
      <p>Evidently wrong-doing had not prospered Stanwood. He had probably come
        out with that degraded, dirty gang, in that “lanch” which stunk of bilge
        water and other filth beyond a white man’s stomach almost, for no other
        reason than to get an opportunity to stow, or to ask a passage
        up&#8212;as Marsden himself had been obliged to ask five years before.
        He would not try it now, of course. He had nerve enough for about
        anything, but hardly enough for that. He would have to wait at least a
        week for another ship and another first-officer. </p>
      <p>It happened, nevertheless, that Marsden wanted another sailor. At the
        last port, Corinto, one of his men had gone ashore to see one of the
        sick mothers he kept along the coast, and that had been the last seen of
        <i>him</i>. Marsden was anxious to fill the vacancy, but Stanwood should
        not have it. He could work with the launch gang a while longer. It was
        small enough punishment for his misdeeds.</p>
      <p>The launch swung alongside. Stanwood was in her. He was having an
        altercation with the <i>capitan</i>, too, and the <i>capitan</i> had
        been taking more <i>tequila</i>, apparently. It would be the course of
        wisdom for the Gringo <i>lanchero</i> to hold his peace and his tongue,
        if he were not looking for a speedy exit from a bad sort of life. The
        <i>capitan</i> and his gang would like nothing better than severally and
        collectively to stick knives into him. </p>
      <p>Once again the launch went off, discharged her cargo, and came back for
        another load. This time it was before the other launch was quite ready
        to be towed away, so she made fast, bow and stern, to her, and the idle
        <i>lancheros</i> fell to eating some food they had brought with them as
        they waited. They crouched together in a group, getting a good deal of
        fun out of it. There were the inevitable <i>frijoles</i> and bread and
        bottled coffee, and there was besides a most unwonted treat, a leg of
        mutton. They passed it from one to the other, and each gnawed at it with
        his gleaming teeth, grinning over the game.</p>
      <p>Stanwood crouched among them. But he was not having fun out of it. He
        was not grinning. He scooped up the common mess of black beans with
        scraps of crust. He was ragged and dirty as they were. But he did not
        take his degradation with their good humor. He looked sullen and lean
        and hungry.</p>
      <p>Marsden watched him. It was not a pleasant sight, and he felt a kind of
        sick disgust and pity. But he wanted to see if the bone of meat would go
        to the white man in the end, and if the white man would take it. It came
        to the last of the natives. He picked it all but clean with a show of
        keen enjoyment. There were a few shreds left. He examined them. Then,
        with the insolence of a base breed having the upper hand, he tossed it
        over at Stanwood. It struck him on the chest. Marsden could see the
        killing hate in his eyes, and the shutting of his teeth under the ragged
        black beard. Then&#8212;and he was conscious of a deep relief&#8212;he
        saw him pick up the bone, stand in the scow, and drop it over into the
        water. </p>
      <p>Marsden turned away. It was not only of relief that he was conscious,
        but of a killing hate of the half-breed <i>lancheros</i> equal to
        Stanwood’s own, as well. </p>
      <p>The clouds which, at noon, had been rising behind the mountains and
        dropping dark into the valleys and cañons, had spread half over the sky.
        There was a low, whining wind, growing steadily stronger. And the seven
        thousand miles of sea stretching unbroken to the west was sending in
        heavier ground swells to the open harbor. The steamer went heaving from
        side to side. Even the sailors were finding it not always easy to keep
        their footing. And it was now that the great iron chimney stacks had to
        be brought up. It would not have been a small matter at the best. At
        present it was extremely dangerous. The loaded lighter had gone off. The
        tackle had been changed on the block of the foremost derrick to new
        hemp, yellow and strong. </p>
      <p>There was the huge clangor and rumble of hollow iron striking against
        iron down in the cargo-space. The mate had taken out his own whistle.
        The responsibility was too great to be intrusted to subordinates here.
        He shrilled one order after another, or shouted them in nautical English
        and strange Spanish, and they were answered from the depths of the hold.
        The monster tube rolled into the opening guided by a man naked to the
        waist, on whose brown torso, swelling with muscles, the sweat rolled and
        glistened. The stack rose slowly upward&#8212;roaring its vast basso
        protests as it struck&#8212;fifty feet long, a yard in diameter, heavy,
        unwieldy, plunging as the ship rolled to starboard, down and down, and
        back to port, down and down again.</p>
      <p>It was a formidable thing, all but unmanageable even there. But once
        clear of the hatchway it flung itself, charging and swinging and
        threshing, with the great iron bellow of warning. The sailors jumped
        from its way. There was only the mate to handle it. The ship gave a
        heavy lurch to starboard. The chimney whirled and lunged toward him with
        a vibrating song of onslaught, and the voice of the white man in the
        launch below called an involuntary “Look out!” An instant of the
        hesitation of fear and the mate would have been struck overboard by all
        the force of the great cylinder of iron. But he put out his hand and
        pushed it, and it swung off harmlessly enough, as docile as it was
        formidable.</p>
      <p>The little whistle shrilled, the derrick moved its long arm around and
        out, and the stack hung overside, directly above the launch. The
        <i>lancheros</i> had retreated to the sides, ready to scramble out of
        the way, or to jump overboard, if need should be. They stood looking up
        at it uneasily. If the rope were to break or slip, if the mate were to
        give a wrong order&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p>Suddenly the steamer came over to starboard with a deep roll, and the
        great stack dropped with her. The mate saw the chance of mishap. His
        whistle piped a sharp, quick order to hoist. The <i>lancheros</i>
        cowered, their arms over their heads&#8212;all but Stanwood. He stood
        watching a chance. The stack swung and whirled, gigantic and awful, not
        a foot above his reach. But the rope had been just too short. The ship
        heaved back, and with a reverberation of metal thunder as it struck
        against the hull, the cylinder swung up again. </p>
      <p>Courage came back to the <i>capitan</i> of the lighter then, and with
        it all his powers of mean impertinence. He shouted up curses at the
        first-officer. They were vile, as curses can only be vile in that
        “language of prayer.” And the first-officer understood them perfectly.
        But he had no time to take notice of them. The ship had got to get off
        that night. And the stacks had got to be unloaded. But it was far from
        simple to get even this first one lowered into the launch. Several times
        they dropped it almost to its place, then, because the empty scow bobbed
        one way in a swell, and the ship another, it had to be hoisted once
        more. And once the windlass refused to work at a signal. There was a
        delay until it could be repaired. The <i>capitan</i> of the
        <i>lancheros</i> waxed more impertinent and abusive; the <i>tequila</i>
        with which he had been refreshing himself on shore was beginning to take
        its violent effect. In the absorption of his abuse of the ship and all
        its crew, he forgot to order his own men. The stack was coming down once
        again, with a fair chance of landing squarely in the bottom at
        last&#8212;if the <i>lancheros</i> should be quick enough at guiding it.
        But they were doing nothing, frightened half out of their little
        available senses. And their <i>capitan</i> was yelling foul words aloft.
        It was a critical instant. The white <i>lanchero</i> knew it. He gave an
        order. It was all the men needed&#8212;a head. They made to obey. But
        the boss, in the madness of <i>tequila</i>, turned on his white hand.
        Was <i>he</i> the <i>capitan</i>? Was <i>he</i> in command? He had the
        signal conch shell in his hand. He brought it down with a cracking blow
        on Stanwood’s head. </p>
      <p>The first-officer, watching the critical descent of the iron monster
        with all his attention, saw Stanwood spring at the boss’s throat, saw
        the knives of the other <i>lancheros</i> drawn, saw them swarming astern
        to the rescue of their fellow, ten of them against one. And the iron
        stack was swaying just above them. Another starboard roll&#8212;they
        would be crushed under it. And another moment lost and the Gringo would
        have ten knives in his neck and back. The little whistle shrilled
        sharply twice, and even as its order was obeyed and the windlass
        reversed, the first-officer was sliding overside down the manrope, had
        kicked himself off from the hull, and landed in the launch. </p>
      <p>It was a short fight. The first-officer had his six-shooter, the white
        <i>lanchero</i> his knife, like another. The natives were fierce with
        blood lust, and the drunkenness of knife gleam and <i>tequila</i>. But
        it was a matter of coolness and of the dominant race. Before the captain
        on the hurricane-deck could run to his cabin for his carbine, it was
        over with. Two <i>lancheros</i> had disabling bullet wounds, and the
        rest had retreated to the bow, all the flush of fight gone out of them,
        whipped and cringing and scared.</p>
      <p>The first-officer and the white <i>lanchero</i> stood astern. They had
        been cut, and the ducks of the first-officer were red. Blood oozed
        through the <i>lanchero’s</i> rags. He got breath for a moment clutching
        at the gunwale. Then he turned to the first-officer. “Thank you,” he
        said.</p>
      <p>Marsden looked at him, slowly, from his shaggy black hair to his bare
        feet. “Don’t mention it,” he answered. Then he looked up at the ship.
        “Unhook that stack for the present, and send down the chair for us,” he
        ordered, coolly. </p>
      <p>He considered his left arm. The blood was bubbling out just above the
        elbow. He knew what it meant. He had seen the thing before. It would be
        all right once a tourniquet should be put above it. But before that,
        before the doctor could get down in the chair, he would very likely
        faint. He was feeling light-headed already&#8212;and his eyes were
        glazing over. He shut his right hand hard above the wound. </p>
      <p>“You can’t stay with this, Stanwood,” he told the <i>lanchero</i>. His
        voice sounded to himself far away and dead. He was not altogether sure
        what he was saying. He glanced up. Away and away overhead in a vague
        distance of hot blue, the chair was beginning to lower. He must make
        haste. He spoke carefully, with precision, swaying unsteadily as the
        launch rolled. </p>
      <p>“We lost a man at Corinto,” he went on; “we&#8212;need an&#8212;other.
        You can ship to Frisco with us if&#8212;&#8212;” he staggered, then
        caught himself, “if you&#8212;like.”</p>
      <p>The chair with the doctor touched the bottom of the scow. The
        first-officer had fallen, and was lying quite still. The white
        <i>lanchero</i> was bending over him, clenching his two hands tight
        about the wounded arm.</p>

        title='The Rajah’s Nemesis'>THE RAJAH’S NEMESIS</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By W. C. Morrow</div>
      <p>In my travels abroad I once encountered an extraordinary illustration
        of the shifts to which Nature will resort in her efforts to overcome the
        inconvenience arising from a deprivation of the tools with which she is
        accustomed to work; and the facts of the case are sufficiently peculiar
        and tragic to warrant their relation. </p>
      <p>I was summoned from Calcutta to proceed to the heart of India, being
        wanted by a certain rich and powerful rajah to perform a dangerous
        surgical operation upon one of the women of his household. I found the
        rajah to be a man of lofty character, noble and generous; but, as
        circumstances afterward developed, he was possessed of a sense of
        cruelty purely Oriental and in sharp contrast to the extreme indolence
        of his disposition. He was so grateful for the success which attended my
        mission that he urged me to remain his guest at the palace as long as it
        should please me to stay; and, as may be surmised, I thankfully accepted
        the invitation. </p>
      <p>One of his servants early attracted my notice, for he was a man of
        marvelous capacity of malice and vindictiveness. His name was Neranya,
        and I am certain that there must have been a large proportion of Malay
        blood in his veins; for, unlike the Indians (from whom he differed also
        in complexion), he was extremely active, alert, nervous, and sensitive.
        He had one redeeming trait, and that was love for his master.</p>
      <p>Once his violent temper led him to the commission of an atrocious
        crime&#8212;the fatal stabbing of a dwarf. In punishment for this the
        rajah ordered that Neranya’s right arm (the offending one) be severed
        from his body. The sentence was executed in rather a bungling fashion by
        a stupid fellow armed with an axe; and I, being a surgeon, was
        compelled, in order to save Neranya’s life, to perform a second
        amputation upon the stump of the arm, which left not a vestige of the
        limb remaining.</p>
      <p>Just here, as a possible partial explanation of the terrible and
        extraordinary things which followed, I must call intelligent attention
        to a matter which has long engaged my notice.</p>
      <p>We see that when one arm has been lost, the other acquires an unwonted
        dexterity, thus measurably compensating for the loss. Further, if both
        arms have been removed, an extraordinary nimbleness is exhibited in the
        feet, for they come to discharge to a considerable extent the functions
        of hands&#8212;to so great an extent that the toes display a power of
        prehension which one might suppose had not existed in them since our
        abandonment, in the evolutionary process, of the tree-climbing habit.
        Thus, with the toes an armless man may learn to hold a pen and to write,
        to load and fire a pistol, to cut food with a knife, and convey it to
        his mouth with a fork, to sew, and to do a hundred other useful things,
        and some which are purely ornamental, as painting, playing a harp, and
        the like. I once saw an armless man give his wife a sound thrashing with
        a rawhide whip.</p>
      <p>If, now, one of the legs be removed, the remaining foot will develop an
        almost redoubled capacity, its agility being marvelous. But suppose that
        this member, too, should be parted with&#8212;has Nature reached the end
        of her resources? Remember, the dexterity that she developed in those
        members which remained after the amputation of others was primarily of a
        character to take the place of that which enabled the others to minister
        to the needs of life. Granted that both arms and both legs are gone, has
        Nature, I have asked, reached the limit of her resources, in the
        accomplishment of an earnest and controlling purpose, praiseworthy or
        perverted?</p>
      <p>Let us inquire into the philosophy of the process by which this
        compensating dexterity is developed. It is easy for the scientists to
        tell us that this is done by the concentration of the will and the
        persistent exercise of the muscles in obedience thereto; but to my
        understanding this explanation is not sufficient. The principle of life,
        the amazing persistence of this principle, and the ways in which this
        persistence is maintained, are all inscrutable mysteries, necessarily
        and forever beyond our comprehension. It is the fashion of
        transcendentalism (not followed, however, by the greater scientists) to
        maintain that we have a spiritual, as well as a material, nature; and by
        evolution there has grown out of that belief another, that this
        spiritual nature is imperishable, indestructible&#8212;the fashionable,
        though inaccurate, term is “immortal.” The spirit is assumed to be the
        <i>ego</i>, the consciousness&#8212;that which fixes individuality and
        determines identity.</p>
      <p>Now, we know that mind is consciousness, and that the mind has its seat
        within the brain. But the brain is identical in its chemical,
        structural, molecular, and functional characteristics with the nerves
        which lead from it and ramify throughout the body; therefore the mind,
        and consequently the spirit, ramifies throughout the body; and hence it
        follows that if the spirit is indestructible and should be separated
        from the body (by death or otherwise) it must have the essential form
        and appearance of the body. The fact of our being unable to see it
        presents no obstacle to the argument; for we are unable to see countless
        things which we are certain exist. The argument thus put in logical
        shape may account, by unconscious synthetical reasoning, for the
        prevalent belief, seemingly inherent, that the spirit retains the form
        of the body after death; for there is no other conception of the human
        spirit’s form&#8212;we never imagine it as having the shape of a ball,
        or a comet, or a balloon, or a cloud, or as being formless.</p>
      <p>Then it must follow that, assuming the spirit to be indestructible and
        as having the form of the body, the amputation of a limb does not
        exterminate that part of the spirit which occupied that limb; but as the
        indivisibility of the spirit must be admitted as an essential factor of
        identity and individuality, that part of the spirit which had occupied
        the amputated limb must always be present in the place where the limb
        had been, and must there, in that place, possess all the consciousness
        and intelligence which belonged to it before the limb was amputated.</p>
      <p>This argument may be pursued to some astonishing conclusions which do
        not vitally concern the purposes of this relation. I might be asked, for
        instance, if the potentiality of a spirit is dependent upon its
        possession and control of a body, of what avail is it to speculate upon
        the unseparated existence of the spirit of an amputated limb? But there
        are some who declare that this dependence need not and does not always
        exist.</p>
      <p>This, it must be understood, is not the line of argument pursued by
        scientists, for they have a purely materialistic explanation for all the
        singular phenomena resulting from amputation; but are they not
        inconsistent? They admit the inscrutable mystery of the principle of
        life and all its countless corollaries, and yet they glibly explain the
        evidently marvelous results of a serious interference with the normal
        operation of that principle, as in the case of amputation. Is it not
        possible that there is danger of too much explanation of these wonderful
        mysteries?</p>
      <p>Let us proceed with the strange story of Neranya. After the loss of his
        arm, he developed an increased fiendishness, an augmented
        vindictiveness. His love for his master was changed to hate, and in his
        mad anger, he flung discretion to the winds. He was so unruly and
        violent in disposition that he could not conceal his feelings. The
        rajah, a proud, scornful man, increased Neranya’s hate by treating him
        with contempt and scorn, which had the effect of driving the wretch to
        frenzy. In a mad moment he sprang upon the rajah with a knife, but he
        was seized and disarmed. To his unspeakable dismay the rajah sentenced
        him for this offense to suffer amputation of the remaining arm. It was
        done as in the former instance.</p>
      <p>This had a temporary effect in curbing the man’s spirit, or rather in
        changing the outward manifestation of his diabolic nature. Being
        armless, he was at first largely at the mercy of those who ministered to
        his wants&#8212;a duty which I undertook to see was properly discharged,
        for I felt an interest in this horribly perverted and distorted nature.
        This sense of helplessness, combined with a damnable scheme for revenge
        which he had secretly formed, caused Neranya to change his fierce,
        impetuous, and unruly conduct into a smooth, quiet, insinuating manner,
        which he carried so artfully as not only to secure a peace and comfort
        which he had never known before, but also to deceive those with whom he
        was brought in contact, including the rajah himself.</p>
      <p>Neranya, being exceedingly quick, nimble, and intelligent, and having a
        tremendous will, turned his attention to the cultivation of dexterity in
        his legs, feet, and toes; and in due time he was able to perform
        wonderful feats with those members, such as I have noticed already. His
        capacity especially for destructive mischief was restored.</p>
      <p>One morning, the rajah’s only son, a young man of an exceedingly
        lovable and noble character, was found dead in bed. His murder was a
        singularly atrocious one, the body being mutilated in a sickening
        manner; but, in my eyes, the most significant of all the mutilations was
        <i>the entire removal and disappearance of the young man’s arms</i>. In
        the wild distraction which ensued in the palace upon the discovery of
        the mutilated body, the importance of that one fact was overlooked. It
        was the basis, however, of a minute investigation, which I made, and
        which, in time, led me to the discovery of the murderer.</p>
      <p>The murder of the young man nearly proved the death of the rajah, who
        was thrown into a serious illness, which required all my skill and
        attention to combat. It was not, therefore, until his recovery that
        there began a systematic and intelligent inquiry into the murder. I said
        nothing of my own discoveries and conclusions, and in no way interfered
        with the work of the rajah and his officers; but, after their efforts
        had failed and I had completed my own work, I submitted to the rajah a
        written report, making a close analysis of all the circumstances, and
        closing by charging Neranya with the murder. (I still have a copy of
        that singular report, and I regret that its length prevents its
        insertion here. It deals with unusual facts and is an illustration of
        the value of special knowledge and pure reason in the detection of
        crime.) My facts, arguments, and deductions were so convincing that the
        rajah at once ordered Neranya to be put to death, this to be
        accomplished by slow and frightful torture. The sentence was so cruel,
        so revolting, that it filled me with horror, and I implored that the
        wretch might be shot. Finally, purely through a sense of noble
        gratitude, the rajah yielded. When Neranya was charged with the crime,
        he denied it, of course; but, seeing that the rajah was convinced, and
        upon being shown my report (which embodied a knowledge of anatomy and
        surgery that he had never dreamed of), he threw aside all restraint,
        and, dancing, laughing, and shrieking in the most horrible manner,
        confessed his guilt and gloated over it&#8212;all this, believing that
        he would be shot on the morrow.</p>
      <p>During the night, however, the rajah changed his mind, and sending for
        me in the morning, informed me of his new decision. It was that
        Neranya’s life should be spared, but that both his legs should be
        crushed with heavy hammers and then that I should amputate both limbs as
        close to the trunk as possible! I was too much astounded to utter a
        protest; and, besides there was grounded within me that unyielding, and
        often inhuman, medical principle, which counts the saving of life at any
        cost the highest duty. I may add that, appended to this horrible
        sentence, was a provision for keeping the maimed wretch a prisoner and
        torturing him at regular intervals by such means as afterward might be
        devised.</p>
      <p>Sickened to the heart by the awful duty which confronted me, I
        nevertheless performed it with success, and I must pass over in silence
        the hideous details of the whole affair. Let it suffice to say that
        Neranya escaped death very narrowly, and that he was a long time in
        recovering his wonted vitality. During all these weeks the rajah neither
        saw him nor made inquiries concerning him, but when, as in duty bound, I
        made an official report that the man had recovered his strength, the
        rajah’s eyes brightened, and he emerged with deadly activity from the
        stupor of grief in which he so long had been plunged. He ordered certain
        preparations made for the future care of his now helpless victim.</p>
      <p>The rajah’s palace was a noble structure, but it is necessary here to
        describe only the grand hall. It was an immense room, with a floor of
        polished stone and a lofty arched ceiling. A subdued light stole into it
        through stained glass set in the roof and in windows on the sides. In
        the middle of the room was a fountain which threw up a tall, slender
        column of water in the centre, with smaller jets grouped around it.
        Across one end of the hall, half-way to the ceiling, was a balcony,
        which communicated with the upper story of a wing, and from which a
        flight of stairs descended to the stone floor of the hall. This room was
        kept at a uniform temperature, and during the hot summers it was
        delightfully cool. This was the rajah’s favorite lounging-place, and
        when the nights were hot, he had his cot brought hither and here he
        slept.</p>
      <p>This hall was chosen for Neranya’s permanent abiding-place; here was he
        to stay as long as he might live, without ever a glimpse of the face of
        nature or the glorious heavens. To one of his restless, nervous,
        energetic, discontented nature, the cruelty of such confinement was
        worse than death; but there was more yet of suffering in store for him,
        for at the rajah’s order there was constructed a small iron pen, in
        which Neranya was to be kept. This pen was circular and about four feet
        in diameter. It was elevated on four slender iron posts, ten feet from
        the floor, and was placed half-way between the fountain and the balcony.
        Around the edge of the pen was erected an iron railing, four feet high,
        but the top was left open for the convenience of the servants whose duty
        it should be to care for him. These precautions for his safe confinement
        were taken at my suggestion, for, although the man was deprived of all
        four of his limbs, I still feared that he might develop some
        extraordinary, unheard-of power for mischief. It was provided that the
        attendants should reach his cage by means of a movable ladder. All these
        arrangements having been made and Neranya hoisted into his prison, the
        rajah emerged upon the balcony to see him, and the two deadly enemies
        faced each other. The rajah’s stern face paled at the hideous sight
        which met his gaze, but he soon recovered, and the old, hard, cruel,
        sinister look returned. Neranya, by an extraordinary motion, had
        wriggled himself into an upright position, his back propped against the
        railing. His black hair and beard had grown long, and they added to the
        natural ferocity of his aspect. Upon seeing the rajah his eyes blazed
        with a terrible light, his lips parted, and he gasped for breath. His
        face was white with rage and despair, and his thin, distended nostrils
        quivered.</p>
      <p>The rajah folded his arms and gazed down upon the frightful wreck which
        he had made. Neranya returned the gaze with blazing eyes. Oh, the pathos
        of that picture, the inhumanity of it, the deep and dismal tragedy of
        it! Who might look into that wild, desperate heart and see and
        understand the frightful turmoil there, the surging, choking passions,
        unbridled but impotent ferocity, frantic thirst for a vengeance that
        should be deeper than hell! Neranya gazed, his shapeless body heaving,
        his eyes ablaze, and then, in a strong, clear voice which rang
        throughout the great hall, with rapid speech he hurled at the rajah the
        most insulting defiance, the most awful curses. He cursed the womb that
        conceived him, the food that nourished him, the wealth that brought him
        power; cursed him in the name of Buddha and all the prophets, in the
        name of heaven and of hell; cursed him by the sun, the moon, and the
        stars, by all continents, oceans, mountains, and rivers, by all things
        living; cursed his head, his heart, his entrails; cursed him in a
        furious outpouring of unmentionable words; heaped insults and contumely
        upon him; called him a knave, a beast, a fool, a liar, an infamous and
        damnable coward. Never had I heard such eloquence of defiance, curses,
        and vituperation; never had heard so terrible a denunciation, so
        frightful and impetuous an outflow of insults.</p>
      <p>The rajah heard it all calmly, without the movement of a muscle or the
        slightest change of countenance, and when the poor wretch had exhausted
        his strength and fallen helpless and silent to the floor, the rajah,
        with a grim, cold smile, turned and strode away.</p>
      <p>The days passed. The rajah, not deterred by Neranya’s curses often
        heaped upon him, spent even more time than formerly in the great hall,
        and slept there oftener at night, and finally Neranya, wearied of
        cursing and defying him, maintained a sullen silence. The man was a
        study for me, and I noticed every change in his fleeting moods.
        Generally his condition was one of miserable despair, which he attempted
        bravely to conceal. Even the boon of suicide had been denied him, for
        when he was erect the top of the rail was a foot above his head, and he
        could not throw himself over it and crush his skull on the stone floor
        below; and when he had tried to starve himself the attendants forced
        food down his throat, so that he abandoned such attempts. At times his
        eyes would blaze and his breath would come in gasps, for imaginary
        vengeance was working within him; but steadily he became quieter and
        more tractable, and was pleasant and responsive when I conversed with
        him. Whatever the tortures the rajah had decided upon, none had as yet
        been ordered, and although Neranya knew that they were in contemplation,
        he never referred to them or complained of his lot.</p>
      <p>The awful climax of this terrible situation was reached one night, and
        even after this lapse of years I can not approach a description of it
        without a shudder.</p>
      <p>It was a hot night, and the rajah had gone to sleep in the great hall
        of the palace, lying on a high cot. I had been unable to sleep in my
        apartment, and so I stole softly into the hall through the heavily
        curtained entrance at the end furthest from the balcony. As I did so, I
        heard a peculiar soft sound above the gentle patter of the fountain.
        Neranya’s cage was partly concealed from my view by the spraying water,
        but I suspected that the unusual sound came from him. Stealing a little
        to one side and crouching against the dark hangings of the wall, I could
        faintly see him in the dim light which illumined the hall, and then I
        discovered that my surmise was correct&#8212;Neranya was at work.
        Curious to learn more, I sank into a thick robe on the floor and watched
        him. My sight was keen and my eyes soon became accustomed to the faint,
        soft light.</p>
      <p>To my great astonishment Neranya was tearing off with his teeth the bag
        which served as his outer garment. He did it cautiously, casting sharp
        glances frequently at the rajah, who, sleeping soundly on his cot,
        breathed heavily. After starting a strip with his teeth, Neranya would
        by the same means attach it to the railing of his cage and then wriggle
        away, much after the manner of a caterpillar’s crawling, and this would
        cause the strip to be torn out the full length of his garment. He
        repeated this operation with incredible patience and skill until his
        entire garment had been torn into strips. Two or three of these he tied
        together with his tongue, lips, and teeth, and secured the ends in a
        similar way to the railing, thus making a short swing on one side. This
        done, he tied the other strips together, doubling some which were weak,
        and in this way he made a rope several feet in length, one end of which
        he made fast to the rail. It then began to dawn upon me that he was
        going to make an insane attempt&#8212;impossible of achievement without
        hands or feet, arms or legs&#8212;to escape from his cage! For what
        purpose? The rajah was asleep in the hall&#8212;&#8212;! I caught my
        breath. Oh, the desperate, insane thirst for revenge which consumed the
        impotent, miserable Neranya! Even though he should accomplish the
        impossible feat of climbing over the railing of his cage and falling to
        the stone floor below (for how could he slide down the rope?), he would
        in all probability be killed or stunned; and even if he should escape
        these dangers it would be impossible for him to climb upon the cot
        without rousing the rajah, and impossible even though the rajah were
        dead! A man without arms or legs might descend by falling, he never
        could ascend by climbing. Amazed at his daring, and fully convinced that
        his sufferings had destroyed his reason, I watched him with breathless,
        absorbing interest.</p>
      <p>He caught the longer rope in his teeth at a point not far from the
        rail. Then, wriggling with great effort to an upright position, his back
        braced against the rail, he put his chin over the swing and worked
        toward one end. He tightened the grasp of his chin upon the swing, and,
        with tremendous exertion, working the lower end of his spine against the
        railing, he began gradually to ascend. The labor was so great that he
        was compelled to pause at intervals, and his breathing was hard and
        painful, and even while thus resting he was in a position of terrible
        strain, and his pushing against the swing caused it to press hard
        against his windpipe and nearly suffocate him. </p>
      <p>After amazing effort he elevated the lower end of his body until it
        protruded above the railing, the top of which was now across the lower
        end of his abdomen. Gradually he worked his body over, going backward,
        until there was sufficient excess of weight on the outer side, and then
        with a quick lurch he raised his head and shoulders and swung into a
        horizontal position. Of course, he would have fallen to the floor below
        had it not been for the rope which he held in his teeth. With such
        nicety had he calculated the distance between his mouth and the point of
        fastening, that the rope tightened and checked him just as he reached
        the horizontal position on the rail. If one had told me beforehand that
        such a feat as this man had accomplished was possible, I would have
        thought him a fool. I continued to watch with intense interest.</p>
      <p>Neranya was now balanced on his stomach across the top of the railing,
        and he eased his position somewhat by bending his spine and hanging down
        as much as possible. Having rested in this position for some minutes, he
        began cautiously to slide off, slowly paying out the rope through his
        teeth. Now, it is quite evident that the rope would have escaped from
        his teeth laterally when he slightly relaxed his hold to let it slip,
        had it not been for a very ingenious device to which he had resorted.
        This consisted in his having made a turn of the rope around his neck
        before he attached the swing, thus securing a three-fold control of the
        rope&#8212;one by his teeth, another by friction against his neck, and a
        third by his ability to compress it between his cheek and shoulder.</p>
      <p>A stupendous and seemingly impossible part of his task was
        accomplished. Could he reach the floor in safety? Gradually he worked
        himself backward over the rail, in momentary imminent danger of falling;
        but his nerve never quivered, and I could see a wonderful glitter in his
        eyes. With something of a lurch, his body fell against the outer side of
        the railing, and he was hanging by his chin. Slowly he worked his chin
        away and then hung suspended by the rope, his neck bearing the weight of
        his trunk. By almost imperceptible degrees, with infinite caution, he
        descended the rope, and finally his unwieldy body rolled upon the floor,
        safe and unhurt!</p>
      <p>What next? Was this some superhuman monster who had accomplished this
        impossible miracle? Would he immediately spring to invisible feet, run
        to the rajah’s bedside, and stab him with an invisible dagger held in an
        invisible hand? No; I was too philosophic for such mad thoughts; there
        was plenty of time for interference. I was quick and strong. I would
        wait awhile and see what other impossible things this monster could do.
      </p>
      <p>Imagine my astonishment when, instead of approaching the sleeping
        rajah, Neranya took another direction. Then it was only escape after all
        that the miserable wretch contemplated and not the murder of the rajah!
        But how could he escape? The only possible way to reach the outer air
        was by ascending the stairs to the balcony and leaving by the corridor,
        which opened upon it, and surely it was impossible for Neranya to ascend
        that long flight of stairs! Nevertheless, he made for the stairs. He
        progressed by lying on his back, with his face toward the point of
        destination, bowing his spine upward, and thus causing his head and
        shoulders to slip nearly an inch forward, straightening his spine and
        pushing forward the lower end of his back a distance equal to that which
        his head had advanced, each time pressing his head to the floor to keep
        it from slipping. His progress was slow, painful, and laborious, as the
        floor was slippery, rendering difficult the task of taking a firm hold
        with his head. Finally, he arrived at the foot of the stairs.</p>
      <p>It was at once manifest that his purpose was to ascend them. The desire
        for freedom must have been strong within him. Wriggling to an upright
        position against the newel-post, he looked up at the great height which
        he had to climb and sighed; but there was no dimming of the bright light
        in his eyes. How could he accomplish the impossible task before him?</p>
      <p>His solution of the problem was very simple. While leaning against the
        newel-post, he fell in a diagonal position and lay safe upon the bottom
        step on his side. Turning upon his back, he wriggled forward along the
        step the necessary few inches to reach the rail, scrambled to an
        upright, but inverted, position against the rail, and then fell and
        landed safely on the second step. This explains the manner in which,
        with inconceivable labor, he accomplished the ascent of the entire
        flight of stairs.</p>
      <p>It being evident that the rajah was not the object of Neranya’s
        movements, the anxiety which I had felt on that account was entirely
        dispelled, and I watched Neranya now only with a sense of absorbing
        interest and curiosity. The things which he had accomplished were
        entirely beyond the wildest imagination, and, in a sense, I was in a
        condition of helpless wonder. The sympathy which I had always felt for
        the unhappy man was now greatly quickened; and as small as I knew the
        chances of his ultimate escape to be, I nevertheless hoped that he would
        succeed. There was a bare chance that he would fall into the hands of
        the British soldiery not far away, and I inwardly prayed for his
        success. Any assistance from me, however, was out of the question; nor
        should it ever be known that I had witnessed the escape. </p>
      <p>Neranya was now upon the balcony, and I could dimly see him wriggling
        along as he slowly approached the door. The rail was low, and I could
        barely see him beyond it. Finally he stopped and wriggled to an upright
        position. His back was toward the hall, but he slowly turned around and
        faced me. At that great distance I could not distinguish his features,
        but the slowness with which he had worked, even before he had fully
        accomplished the ascent of the stairs, was evidence all too eloquent of
        his extreme exhaustion. Nothing but a most desperate resolution could
        have sustained him thus far, but he had about drawn upon the last
        remnant of his strength.</p>
      <p>He looked around the hall with a sweeping glance, and then upon the
        rajah, who was soundly sleeping immediately beneath him, over twenty
        feet down. He looked long and earnestly, sinking lower, and lower, and
        lower upon the rail. Suddenly, to my inconceivable astonishment and
        dismay, he toppled over and shot downward from his lofty height. I held
        my breath, expecting to see him crushed into a bloody mass on the stones
        beneath, but instead of that he fell full upon the rajah’s breast,
        crashing through the cot, and hurling him to the floor. I sprang forward
        with a loud cry for help, and was instantly at the scene of the
        disaster. Imagine my indescribable horror when I found that Neranya’s
        teeth were buried in the rajah’s throat! With a fierce clutch I tore the
        wretch away, but the blood was pouring out in torrents from the
        frightfully lacerated throat, the chest was crushed in, and the rajah
        was gasping in the death agony. People came running in, terrified. I
        turned to Neranya. He lay upon his back, his face hideously smeared with
        blood. Murder, and not escape, was his intention from the beginning; he
        had adopted the only plan by which there was a possibility of
        accomplishing it. I knelt beside him, and saw that he was
        dying&#8212;his back had been broken by the fall. He smiled sweetly into
        my face; and the triumphant look of accomplished revenge sat upon his
        face even in death.</p>

        title='The Man-Hunters’ Reward'>THE MAN-HUNTERS’ REWARD</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Buckey O’Neill</div>
      <p>“That isn’t a bad reward!”</p>
      <p>“No; if a fellow could catch him, he would make pretty good wages.
        Let’s see,” and the second speaker began to read the postal-card that
        the postmaster at Hard Scrabble had just tacked to the door of the store
        that constituted the “office,” so that every one might read:</p>
      <div class='tac mt07'>TAKE HIM IN!</div>
      <p class='bq mb07'>$500 Reward will be paid for the arrest and delivery of
        Rube White to the sheriff of Yavapai County. He is about twenty-five
        years old, six feet tall, and slim, with light complexion, and has a big
        scar on the right side of his face. He is wanted for robbery and other
        crimes. If killed in resisting arrest the reward will be paid on
        satisfactory proof of his identity. When last heard from was making for
        the Tonto Basin country. </p>
      <p>By the time the reader had finished, a crowd of half a dozen or more
        men surrounded him.</p>
      <p>“Now, if that feller is headed for the Tonto Basin country, it wouldn’t
        be much of a trick to take him,” said the first speaker, reflectively,
        as if debating with himself the advisability of making the attempt.</p>
      <p>“If you hear me, he ain’t going to be taken in, and the feller that
        tries it is going to have his hands full. They have been after him for
        two or three years and aint got him yet. They say he’s right on the
        shoot,” remarked another of the crowd.</p>
      <p>“Well, a feller ought to know him as soon as he sees him, from that
        description,” hazarded the first speaker, “if he got up close enough to
        see the scar; and then all he’d have to do would be to turn loose at him
        if he didn’t throw up his hands when you told him. Besides, nobody but
        him would try to cross over the mountains into the basin with this snow
        on the ground. Blamed if I don’t think I’ll go after him.”</p>
      <p>“Well, somebody ought to round him up,” asserted some one in the crowd;
        “he’s been foolin’ roun’ hyah long enough, jes havin’ his own way,
        sorter as if the country belonged to him. Durned if I wouldn’t go with
        you, Hi, if I didn’t have to take this grub over to the boys in camp.”
      </p>
      <p>“Well, if any of you want to go, all right. I’m going,” replied the man
        addressed as Hi.</p>
      <p>It was not the first time that Hi Lansing had been on such expeditions.
        He was one of those men for whom danger seems to have a fascination. At
        his remark, Frank Crandall, a young fellow who had been standing quietly
        by, volunteered to accompany him. The crowd turned toward him with more
        interest than they had thus far evinced during the entire proceedings.
        It was but a few months since he had come among them, fresh from the
        East, to take charge of one of the mines which had been closed down by
        the winter’s storms. For weeks he had been cooped up in the isolated
        settlement, and he longed for something to break its monotony.</p>
      <p>“Well, get your horse and gun, and come,” replied Hi, and, in an
        instant, the two men had left the room to arm and equip themselves for
        the chase, while the loungers gathered around the stove to discuss the
        probabilities of their success. In a few minutes, the two men rode past
        the door, each armed with a rifle and six-shooter, and the crowd,
        stepping out, bade them good-by, with the oft-repeated warning: “Be
        keerful and don’t let him get the drop on ye.”</p>
      <p>The crust of the unbroken snow cracked crisply under foot as the two
        rode on fast, leaving the little settlement in their rear. For some time
        neither spoke; but, at last, the silence was broken by Lansing, asking
        his young companion: “Did you ever try this kind of thing before?”</p>
      <p>“No,” replied the young man; “I never have.”</p>
      <p>“Well, then, you want to be keerful. If you don’t lose yer head, you’re
        all right. The only danger is that we may run on him before we know it.”
      </p>
      <p>“And if we do, what then?” asked the young man.</p>
      <p>“Well, he will probably commence shooting, and if he does, and you
        arn’t hit the first rattle out of the box, why you want to git off’n
        your horse and git behind something and shoot back. If ther aint
        anything to git behind, keep your horse between you and him, and keep
        a-shooting. Whatever you do, don’t let go of your gun. But what we want
        to do is to see him first, and then we’ve got the play on him, and all
        you have to do is to tell him to throw up.”</p>
      <p>“And if he don’t throw up?” asked Crandall.</p>
      <p>“Why, then you let him have it. The reward will be paid just the same.”
      </p>
      <p>The apparent indifference with which Lansing spoke of the entire
        matter, much as if he were discussing the best method of hunting a wild
        animal, shocked the young man; but he had committed himself too far to
        withdraw. Besides he had that feeling that all men have when they are
        young&#8212;the curiosity to know whether or not he could rely on
        himself when danger threatened.</p>
      <p>“We should strike his trail on the hills here, if he is really headed
        for the basin country,” said Lansing. They had been riding for several
        hours in silence through the snow, unbroken by aught save the scattered
        pines that here and there dotted the mesa. Before them towered the
        mountains through whose passes the man whom they were after would have
        to pass in his search for safety in the half-settled wilds beyond.</p>
      <p>As the two men rode along, scanning in each direction the snow-covered
        mesa, Lansing suddenly wheeled his horse to the right, and when Crandall
        joined him he pointed to a narrow trail where two horses had passed
        through the snow.</p>
      <p>“That’s him. He’s driving one horse and leading another, and he hasn’t
        passed by very long, either. See, the snow hasn’t had time to drift in
        it,” said he.</p>
      <p>With the discovery his whole demeanor had changed. A new look came into
        his eyes, and his voice sounded strange. He even grasped his weapons in
        a manner different to that he had heretofore displayed. “He’s right
        ahead, and we want to look out,” the older man continued, as they began
        to follow the trail. As they approached the summit of each hill they
        would stop their horses, and Lansing would dismount and crawl to the top
        so that he might look, without being discovered, into the valley beyond,
        in order that they might not come on the fugitive too suddenly.</p>
      <p>They had traveled this way for several miles, when, reining in his
        horse, Lansing pointed to what seemed an old road leading off to the
        right of the one they were following, and said: “That’s the ‘cut-off’
        into the basin. I thought he would take it, but he probably doesn’t know
        the country. You had better take it and ride on ahead until you strike
        the road we’re on again. Then if you can’t find his tracks, you had
        better ride back to meet me until you do. I will follow the trail up.”
      </p>
      <p>The young man tried to expostulate with Lansing for the great risk he
        was assuming, in thus following the trail alone, but his companion was
        obdurate, and, cutting the argument short by again warning the young man
        to be on his guard, he rode on, following the trail in the snow, while
        the younger man, finding objection useless, took the “cut-off” road. He
        had no difficulty in following it, and he wondered why the man they were
        in pursuit of had not taken advantage of it. The whole pursuit seemed
        almost like a dream to him. The snow, unbroken save by his horse’s
        footfall, stretched away mile after mile in every direction, with here
        and there a pine through whose branches the wind seemed to sob and sigh,
        making the only noise that broke the stillness of the wintry afternoon.
        It added to this feeling. Not a thing in sight. He began to depict in
        his own mind the manner of man they were pursuing. He had almost
        forgotten his name. After all, what had the man done that he, Frank
        Crandall, should be seeking his blood? Perhaps, like himself, the man
        had a mother and sisters to grieve over any misfortune that would
        overtake him. These and a hundred kindred thoughts passed through his
        mind. The sun was fast declining as he passed from the “cutoff” into the
        main road again. The air was getting chilly with the coming of evening,
        and the snow in the distance took on colors of pink and purple where the
        rays of the setting sun touched the mountain peaks. He scanned the main
        road eagerly to see if the man they were in pursuit of had passed, but
        the snow that covered it was unbroken. Then he rode back on the main
        road, in the direction from which he had come, to meet his comrade and
        the fugitive. He had just ascended one of the many rolling hills, when,
        in the distance, he discovered a man riding one horse and driving
        another. At the sight his heart almost stood still. He dismounted, and
        leading his horse to one side, concealed him in a clump of young pines.
        Then he returned to the road-side and waited. The man was urging his
        horses forward, but they seemed to be wearied, and made but slow
        progress. Crandall felt his heart beat faster and faster at the length
        of time it took the man to reach him. He examined his revolver and
        rifle, cocking each, to see that they were in order. It seemed to
        relieve the tension of his nerves. After he had done this, he knelt down
        so that he could fire with surer aim, and waited. He did not care much
        now whether the man resisted or not. If the fugitive resisted, he would
        have to stand the consequence of resistance. It was nothing to him. He
        could hear the footfall of the approaching horses in the snow, and he
        cocked his rifle so as to be ready. The setting sun shone full in the
        man’s face, but Crandall forgot to look for the scar that the notice had
        said was on the right cheek, although he had resolved to do so
        particularly. When he first discovered the fugitive, he scanned the road
        behind him to discover Lansing, but the nearer the man approached, the
        less Crandall cared whether Lansing came or not. He let the man approach
        nearer and nearer, so that his aim would be the more accurate. He could
        not afford to throw away the first shot. The face of the man grew more
        and more distinct. He seemed to be oblivious to his surroundings.
        Crandall felt almost disposed to let him pass, but the thought that
        every one would think him a coward if he did so, spurred him on, and,
        rising erect, he ordered the man to surrender. The horse that the man
        was driving in front of him, frightened at Crandall’s appearance,
        swerved from the road, leaving the two men facing each other. For an
        instant, Crandall looked straight into the other’s eyes. Then the man
        raised his rifle from the pommel of the saddle, and Crandall fired. The
        horse which the man was riding sprang from the road, and, at the same
        moment, its rider’s gun was discharged. The smoke from Crandall’s own
        gun blew back into his eyes, and he turned from it to follow the
        movements of the man at whom he had fired. As he saw the man still erect
        in his saddle, he felt the feverish haste to fire again come over him
        that men feel when they have shot and missed, and know that their life
        may be the forfeit of their failure. He threw another cartridge into the
        chamber of his rifle, and raised it to his shoulder, but before he could
        fire, the man reeled from his saddle and fell, while his frightened
        horse galloped off through the pines.</p>
      <p>Crandall stepped toward him, holding his rifle prepared to fire again,
        if necessary. As he did so, the man raised his hand and said, simply:
        “Don’t fire&#8212;you’ve got me.”</p>
      <p>The snow was already red with blood where he lay. For the first time,
        Crandall looked for the scar that the description said was on the right
        cheek. For an instant he did not see it, and his heart seemed to stop
        beating with the fear of having made a mistake, and when, on drawing
        nearer, he saw that it was there, that only the pallor which had spread
        over the man’s face had made it indistinct, he could have cried out with
        joy at the feeling of relief that passed over him. </p>
      <p>“Are you badly wounded?” he asked.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how bad it is. It is here somewhere,” the man said,
        placing his hand on his breast, as if not certain of the exact spot. “It
        feels numb-like,” he added. Stooping down, Crandall unbuckled and took
        off the man’s pistol-belt and threw it into the snow, where lay his
        rifle, and then he tore open the man’s shirt. As he did so his fingers
        came in contact with the warm blood, and he involuntarily drew back,
        with a feeling of disgust. </p>
      <p>“Did you find it?” asked the man, who was watching him closely, and who
        had observed the movement.</p>
      <p>Recalled to himself by the question, Crandall again tore at the shirt,
        exposing the breast. Where the blood did not cover it, it looked like
        marble, despite the dark hair on it. He could not see the wound, on
        account of the blood, until he had wiped the latter from the breast, and
        then he found it.</p>
      <p>“What do you think of it?” the man asked.</p>
      <p>“There it is,” replied Crandall. He could not say more. The appealing
        tone in the man’s voice for some hope&#8212;some
        encouragement&#8212;made him feel faint and sick.</p>
      <p>“What do you think of it?” the man repeated, in a querulous voice, and,
        as he did so, he coughed until his mouth filled with blood, and he spat
        it out on the white snow.</p>
      <p>Crandall shook his head and walked toward where his horse was tied. He
        felt that if he watched the wounded man any longer he would faint.
        Noticing his walking away, the wounded man said: “For God’s sake, don’t
        leave me. Now that you have killed me, stay with me, and don’t let me
        die like a dog.”</p>
      <p>The voice was one of entreaty, and Crandall returned and seated himself
        in the snow by the man’s side. The sun had gone down, and the twilight
        had come on, bringing with it the chill of night. Crandall covered the
        wounded man’s body with his overcoat, and raised his head from the snow.
        Almost unconsciously he noted that as the patch of red made by the blood
        grew larger and larger, the face of the wounded man grew whiter and
        whiter. He never took his eyes from Crandall’s face, while his breath
        came quicker and shorter, as if he breathed with labor. With each breath
        the blood seemed to bubble from the wound in the breast. One of the
        man’s hands fell from under the coat that covered him. As Crandall
        raised it from the snow, its coldness sent a chill through him. Once he
        had asked the wounded man if he could do anything for him; but the man
        had only shaken his head in reply. Crandall felt like reviling himself
        for what he had done, and wondered why the wounded man did not reproach
        him. Even when he expressed his sorrow at having shot him, the dying man
        had said, gently: “Don’t mind it. It’s too late now.”</p>
      <p>The twilight gave way to darkness, and still he sat there. He could not
        hear the dying man breathe without leaning over his face. He did not do
        this but once, though, and then the dying man had opened his eyes and
        looked up into his face, inquiringly. Crandall would rather have stayed
        there until morning than to have caught that look again. </p>
      <p>Suddenly he heard a voice call to him. He started as if he had been
        fired at, but it was only Lansing. As he answered the call, Lansing rode
        forward and, seeing the outstretched form on the snow, said: “By God,
        you got him!” </p>
      <p>“Hush!” replied Crandall, fearful lest the wounded man would hear the
        exulting tone which grated on his own ears as nothing had ever before
        done. But not minding the admonition, Lansing dismounted, and striking a
        match held it close to the man’s face. It was pale and cold, and the
        half-opened eyes were glazed. They did not even reflect the light made
        from the match, but from the partly opened mouth a tiny stream of
        half-congealed blood seemed to be still flowing down over the beard.</p>
      <p>“That’s him, and it’s a pretty good day’s work we have done by earning
        that reward,” said Lansing, coolly, as the match went out. </p>
      <p>Somehow, though, as Crandall lay awake through the night, within a few
        yards of the body, to keep the wolves from it so that it would be
        unmarred in the morning when they would lash it to a horse and take it
        into the settlements for identification, he wondered why Lansing could
        sleep so soundly. As for himself, the rigid form, covered with only a
        saddle-blanket, lying where the snow was red instead of white, was
        always before his eyes, even when he closed them.</p>

      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Geraldine Bonner</div>
      <p>In January the darkness settles early in Paris. It was not yet five,
        and it was closing in, soft and sudden. This particular night it was
        rendered denser by the light rain that was falling&#8212;one of those
        needle-pointed, noiseless rains that come in the midst of a Paris winter
        and persist for days.</p>
      <p>Celia Reardon came home through it, letting her skirts flap against her
        heels. The package of sketches she had not sold to the dealer on the Rue
        Bonaparte was under her arm. From beneath the dark tent of her umbrella
        she looked straight before her down the vista of the street, glistening
        and winking from its lamps and windows. The light, striking clearly on
        her face, revealed it as small, pale, and plain, with a tight line of
        lip, and eyes sombrely staring at nothing. She made no attempt to lift
        her sodden skirt or avoid puddles.</p>
      <p>Walking heavily forward through the early dusk, she was advancing to
        meet the giant Despair.</p>
      <p>This was on her mind, and, to the observant eye, in her face. Celia
        knew of only one way to evade the approaching giant. It was by the turn
        that led to the river. Many people, in their terror at his approach,
        took this turn. She had seen them in the morgue in the days when she was
        new to Paris, and went about seeing the sights like a tourist.</p>
      <p>After the dealer on the Rue Bonaparte had given her back the sketches,
        telling her it was impossible to sell them, she had turned downward
        toward the <i>quais</i>, and came out there, under the skeleton trees,
        where the book-stalls line the wall. The dark, slumberous current of the
        river swept by under the gemmed arches of its bridges. It was carrying
        away all the foul and useless things of the day’s tumultuous life, all
        going helter-skelter, pell-mell, to the oblivion of the sea.</p>
      <p>She thought of herself going with them, whirling about in the currents,
        serenely indifferent to everything that tortured her now. The thought
        had a creeping fascination. She drew nearer, staring down at the water,
        stabbed with hundreds of quivering lights, and saw herself&#8212;a face,
        a trail of hair, a few folds of eddying drapery&#8212;go floating by. A
        sudden gust of wind snatched at her umbrella, and shook a deluge from
        the tree boughs, fretting the surface of the pools. It roused her, and
        she turned away shuddering. She would wait and meet the Giant face to
        face.</p>
      <p>As she turned into the <i>impasse</i> where her studio was, she felt
        that he was getting very near. The long walk had tired her. Since
        yesterday her only food had been the free tea at the Girls’ Club. Her
        door was the last on the left-hand side, and broke the face of what
        looked a blank wall. Near it a bell-handle hung on the end of a wire. On
        the fourth floor she opened a door that had her card nailed to it.</p>
      <p>The studio was dark, only the large window showed a dim, gray square.
        She lit the lamp, and then, suddenly, in the recklessness of her
        desperation, the fire. There were eight pieces of wood and six
        briquettes in the box. She would burn them all. She would burn the bed
        and the chairs, but she would be warm to-night. To-morrow was twelve
        hours off.</p>
      <p>The light showed the emptiness of the chill, barn-like room. The walls
        alone were furnished, decorated with a series of life-class studies,
        some made twenty years before, when she had been the star of one of the
        Julians. Now these spirited delineations of nakedness, unlovely and
        unabashed, offered silent testimony to the brilliant promise of Celia
        Reardon’s youth. To-night she only thought of the fire and cowered over
        it&#8212;a little, pale shadow of a woman, near upon middle age. </p>
      <p>For hours she sat watching the flames dart up through the holes in the
        briquettes. The warmth consoled her. She grew dreamy and retrospective.
        Her thoughts went slipping back from point to point, in the glamourous
        past, when she had been hung in the Salon, and sold her pictures, and
        was an artist people spoke of who would some day “arrive.” From those
        radiant days of youth and hope, things had been gradually declining to
        this&#8212;one by one stand-bys failing and her old patrons leaving,
        rich Americans who ordered copies growing scarcer and scarcer. Finally
        no money to hire models, bad food, and, in consequence, declining
        health, poor work that failed to find a market; pride coming to her aid
        and withdrawing her from the help of friends; furtive visits to the Mont
        de Piete, and more dreaded ones to the dealers on the Rue Bonaparte; and
        to-night the end of all things.</p>
      <p>It was late when she slept. Waking in the gray dawn she found herself
        lying cramped and cold in front of the white ashes of the fire, and
        crept shivering to bed. There she slept on till after midday. She felt
        weak and stupid when she rose, and her dressing took a long time. She
        began to realize that her state was nearly as bad physically as it was
        financially. </p>
      <p>It was better to walk about the streets till the hour for tea than to
        freeze in the studio. She put on her hat and jacket, relics of better
        days to which she desperately clung, and went forth. In the night the
        thermometer had fallen and the rain had turned to snow. She buried her
        chin in her collar and tried to walk briskly. She thought she would go
        to the Louvre, which was warm, and sit there till four, when she could
        come back to the Girls’ Club. Both walks were long, but the hour’s rest
        at the Louvre would strengthen her, and there was still the faint
        possibility of meeting some one she knew who would order a copy.</p>
      <p>She felt singularly tired when the long flank of Catharine de’ Medici’s
        part of the old palace came into view with the river sucking at the
        wall. All the surroundings were gray and motionless like a picture, and
        in the midst of this dead immobility the swift, turbulent tide rolled
        on, a thing of sinister life, calling to her as it sped. Midway across
        the bridge she stopped to look down on it, and then stood gazing,
        fascinated, unable to tear herself away.</p>
      <p>Close to her, on the coping of the wall, an image-seller had set out
        his wares. They were a dream of fair women, classic and modern. The
        solemn majesty of the great Venus was contrasted with Phryne hiding her
        eyes in a spasm of modesty. Clytie, with the perfect fall of her
        shoulders, rising from the lily leaves that fold back as if unwilling to
        hide so much beauty, stood droopingly beside the proud nakedness of
        Falguière’s Diane. The boy who presided over this gallery of
        loveliness&#8212;a meagre Italian, his face nipped with
        frost&#8212;stood a hunched-up, wretched figure, his eyes questioning
        the passers-by.</p>
      <p>Presently one of these halted in the hurrying march with an eye on
        Clytie. The boy drew his hands from his pockets, and with piteous
        eagerness held out the bust. The tones of his voice penetrated Celia’s
        dark musings, and she looked that way.</p>
      <p>The buyer was a lady, young, and of a curiously soft and silly
        prettiness. She displayed all of a Parisienne’s flawless finish. Her
        cheek, by art or nature, was like a magnolia petal; her hair showed
        burnished on its loose ripples. Beneath the edge of her veil her
        uncovered mouth appeared, fresh as a child’s, serious, and charmingly
        foolish. Her chin rested on a fluff of white tulle and was a white of a
        warmer tint. There was dubious debate in her glance as it paused on the
        figures. She looked the incarnation of sweet indecision. Presently she
        decided on Clytie, and said she would take it with her. Celia knew she
        had bought the head from a sudden, careless pity for the boy’s red nose
        and chilblains. If <i>she</i> had peddled sketches on the bridge, with
        her nose red and her toes coming through her boots, she, too, would have
        made money, she thought, as she hungrily wondered how much the boy had
        made by his sale.</p>
      <p>The lady unclasped the little bag that hung by a chain to her wrist,
        and searched for money. She was evidently careless, and carried many
        things therein. Suddenly she jerked out a whisp of pocket-handkerchief,
        and under it found the <i>cache</i> where the money had been secreted.
        She bent her face to search for the desired coin, and so did not see
        that with the handkerchief a five-franc piece had been twitched out.</p>
      <p>Celia did see. She saw it spring out, and then drop into a bank of
        snow, noiselessly, as if purposely to avoid detection. She made a step
        forward to pick it up and return it. And then she stopped&#8212;a
        thought went through her like a zigzag of lightning. Cupidity, born of
        hunger, burst into life in her, and nailed her to the spot, her mouth
        dry, her eyes vacant of expression. For the first time in her life
        Temptation gripped her.</p>
      <p>The traditions of generations of seemly New England forbears cried out
        upon her and struggled within her. But she stood her ground. The coin
        lying in the snow seemed of more importance to her than everything else
        in the world. </p>
      <p>As the lady passed away, Celia drew near the images. The boy was
        rearranging them. When his back was turned she bent down and groped in
        the snow. Then rose with her face red.</p>
      <p>She crushed down the shame that surged in her, and turned to leave the
        bridge. There is a Duval on the Boulevard St. Germain, and she almost
        ran to it, thinking as she went of what she would order. She would spend
        two francs and a half, allowing a twenty-five centime <i>pourboire</i>
        for the girl. </p>
      <p>It was not the crowded hour, and she had no need to hurry. She ate
        sumptuously and slowly, and began to feel the revivifying tide of life
        flowing back into her starved body. The Giant began to look dim and
        distant. The river called no more. In the leisurely French fashion she
        sat a long time over her meal. The day was darkening to its early
        twilight as she emerged and fared down the boulevard.</p>
      <p>She was walking slowly down the great street, her body warmed, the
        cries of her hunger stilled, when the enormity of her act began to force
        itself upon her. She refused to acknowledge it at first. Hunger was
        sufficient excuse. But not so much her conscience as her sense of dainty
        self-respect insisted on her shame. She was a thief. Her whiteness was
        stained forever. She had never before done anything for which to blush
        or to lie. Her poverty, her discouragement, her pitiful, proud
        struggles, had always been honest. She would as soon have thought of
        murdering some one as of stealing from them. </p>
      <p>Now she had done it. One moment’s temptation had marked her forever. As
        the money had fallen into the snow something in her had fallen, never to
        rise. </p>
      <p>Pursued by harassing thoughts, she half-unconsciously wended her way
        toward the river. Here, unencumbered by houses, daylight still lingered.
        The gray afternoon was dying with a frosty brilliance. In its death
        throes it exhaled a sudden, angry red which broke through the clouds in
        smoldering radiance. Its flush tinted the sky and touched the tops of
        the wavelets, and Celia felt it on her face like the color of shame.</p>
      <p>As she stood staring at it, her pallor glazed with an unnatural blush,
        an inspiration came to her which sent a tide of real color into her
        face. A manner of redeeming herself suddenly was revealed to her. She
        would give the rest of the money to the most needy person she met that
        evening. She would walk the city till she found some one more deserving
        of it than she. Then she would give all she had&#8212;share her theft
        with some other pauper to whom two francs would mean salvation.</p>
      <p>She felt instantly stimulated and revived by a return of self-respect.
        Either side of the river would be rich in case of heartbreak and hunger.
        Standing in the middle of the bridge, she looked from the straight line
        of gray houses on the Quai Voltaire to the vast façade of the Louvre.
        Then some whim impelled her to choose the side of the city where wealth
        dwells, and she walked forward toward the <i>guichets</i> of the old
        palace.</p>
      <p>The city had on the first phase of its evening aspect of brilliantly
        illumined gayety. People were dining; she caught glimpses of them over
        the half-curtains of restaurant windows. Women in voluminous wraps were
        making mincing exits from the hotel doorways to waiting fiacres. There
        was the <i>frou-frou</i> of skirts, whiffs of perfumery, the shifting of
        many feet under the arcades of the Rue de Rivoli.</p>
      <p>Passing the entrance of one of the largest hotels, she was arrested by
        a familiar voice, and a richly clad and rustling lady deflected her
        course from the carriage that awaited her at the curb toward the
        astonished artist. Celia felt a curious sensation of fatefulness when
        she saw in the face before her that of an old patron, long absent from
        Paris. The lady gave her a warm greeting; she wanted to see her
        to-morrow, apropos of some copies to be made. Had Celia time to make the
        copies? Well, then, would she come to lunch to-morrow and talk it over?
      </p>
      <p>The little artist blinked in the glare of the doorway and the lady’s
        diamonds. She would.</p>
      <p>And now would she go to the theatre with the lady? Only her niece was
        with her, and they had a box.</p>
      <p>No&#8212;Celia could not do that. She
        had&#8212;er&#8212;business&#8212;business that might keep her up very
        late. </p>
      <p>The carriage rolled away with the lady and the niece, and Celia turned
        up one of the side streets that lead to the great boulevard. So Fortune
        was going to smile on her once more. All the more reason to square
        things with her conscience. She grasped her purse tightly and looked
        about her as she passed up the narrow thoroughfare. Misery often lurked
        ashamed in corners. She knew just how and why. </p>
      <p>A few moments more walking, with an occasional turn into cross-cuts,
        brought her into the spacious widening of the ways before the Gare St.
        Lazare. It was particularly lively inside the depot inclosure, as the
        boat train for Calais was soon to leave. There was an incessant rattling
        of carriages piled high with trunks, and a great disgorging of
        travelers, who ran staggering up the steps weighted with the amazing
        amount of hand luggage indispensable to the Continental tourist.</p>
      <p>Certainly it did not look a promising place in which to seek distressed
        humanity. Celia turned away and began to walk upward toward the street
        which flanks the building on the left, and winds an ascending course
        toward Montmartre. It was badly lit, sheltered by the vast blank wall of
        the depot, and showed only an occasional passer-by, and the lamps of a
        long line of waiting fiacres.</p>
      <p>As she advanced into the semi-obscurity of this dark byway, a carriage
        rattled up and stopped precipitately near the side entrance into the
        yard. A man sprang out and then turned with a sort of elaboration of
        gallantry and helped out a woman. Celia idly noted her trim foot as it
        felt for the step, her darkly clad, elegant figure, then her face. It
        came with a shock of familiarity on its smooth, rounded prettiness; now,
        however, no longer placid, but deeply disturbed. Under it unwonted
        currents of feeling were corrugating the brow and making the lips droop.
        Only an eye used to note faces would have recognized it as that of the
        woman who had bought the head of Clytie a few hours before.</p>
      <p>Celia loitered, and then drew back into the shadow of the wall. The
        woman was evidently in the grip of mental distress. Apprehension,
        indecision, terror almost, were stamped on her mobile and childish
        countenance. The man stretched his hand inside the carriage and pulled
        out two valises. He spoke to her, shortly but with slightly veiled
        tenderness, and with a start like a frightened animal she drew back into
        the shadow. He paid the driver, and then, standing between the bags, he
        drew out his pocket-book and gave her some murmured instructions.</p>
      <p>She suddenly interrupted him in a louder key.</p>
      <p>“I have my ticket,” she said, “I bought it this afternoon. I passed
        Cook’s, and went in and bought it.”</p>
      <p>“You bought it yourself?” giving her a fatuously loving look from under
        his hat-brim, “you were afraid we would perhaps be late? Dear one, how
        thoughtful!”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what I thought. Oh, yes, I do. I thought if I went in to
        buy it here with you I might see some one I knew. That would be so
        dreadful.” </p>
      <p>“Of course, you must not go in with me. You must wait here. Keep back
        in the shadow there while I’m gone.”</p>
      <p>“Here&#8212;take it&#8212;Oh, I’m so nervous! Take it, and get yours,
        and then come back.”</p>
      <p>She feverishly clawed off the little bag she wore on her wrist, and
        thrust it into his hand. Though less obviously so, the man was also
        nervous. He clutched up his valises, and put them down; then glanced
        uneasily up and down the street’s dim length.</p>
      <p>“I’ll go alone and buy mine,” he said, “and put the bags in the
        compartment. I’ll be gone a few moments. You wait here, and don’t move
        till I come for you.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, of course, not. I shouldn’t dare. And please hurry. I don’t see
        how I will ever be able to get in. At any moment I might meet some one I
        know. Think of what that would be! I had no idea this was going to be so
        terrible. It’s not easy to do wrong.”</p>
      <p>“Do wrong?” echoed the man, in a tone of tender, though somewhat
        hurried, reproof. “Don’t say such foolish things. We have a right to
        happiness. Oh&#8212;er&#8212;haven’t you got a veil you could put on
        when you enter the Gare? It would be better.” </p>
      <p>A bell rang within the building, and the woman gave a suppressed
        shriek. </p>
      <p>“Oh, go&#8212;go!” she cried wildly. “Don’t stop to talk now. That may
        be the train. What would happen if we missed it?”</p>
      <p>The bell struck him into action, too, and he hurried off, swaying
        between the two heavy valises.</p>
      <p>Celia, from her station near the wall, was too smitten by the sudden
        revelation before her to have will to move. So she was eloping, this
        baby-cheeked creature, whose kindly impulse had prompted her to buy the
        Clytie from the frost-nipped boy on the bridge. Without any natural
        predisposition in that direction, she was going the way of the Devil,
        and even at this stage stood aghast, bemused, and terrified at what she
        had done.</p>
      <p>The Frenchwoman moved forward into the light, and stood for a moment
        watching her departing lover. Then she began to send fearful glances up
        and down the street. Celia thought she could hear her breathing, and the
        thumping of her heart. It was not hard to see how she had been cajoled
        and overruled.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, from the fullness of her heart her mouth spoke: “Oh, I want
        to go home.” She spoke aloud, making at the same moment a gesture of
        clasping her hands. Her face took on an expression as near to resolution
        as possible. Its flower-soft curves stiffened. Her lover was gone, and
        her hypnotized will was struggling to life. </p>
      <p>She turned desperately toward the line of carriages and beckoned to the
        <i>cocher</i> of the nearest one, then dropped the raised hand to her
        wrist, where the bag had hung. It encountered nothing, and in a moment
        she remembered that her purse was with the man.</p>
      <p>“Good God!” she said, and this time the violent Gallic ejaculation
        sounded appropriate.</p>
      <p>As the carriage rattled up, Celia came out of the shadow. She spoke
        excellent French, and the Parisienne might have thought her a
        fellow-countrywoman. “What is the matter?” she said, quietly. “Do you
        feel sick?”</p>
      <p>“No&#8212;no&#8212;but my money is gone. I gave my purse to my friend,
        and now I want to go back.”</p>
      <p>“But he’ll be here again in a minute.”</p>
      <p>“That’s just it&#8212;in a minute. And I must go before he comes back,
        and I have no money.”</p>
      <p>“You can always pay the <i>cocher</i> at the house.”</p>
      <p>“Not now&#8212;not to-night.”</p>
      <p>She was far past a regard for the ordinary reticences of every-day
        life, but the humiliation of her admission was in her face. “My
        husband&#8212;he’s there, with only one old servant. He thinks I’m in
        the country with my mother. So I was till this afternoon. If I come home
        unexpectedly with no money to pay the <i>cocher</i>, he will be
        surprised. He will be angry. He will want to know all about it&#8212;I
        can’t explain it or tell more lies. I was mad when I said I’d go. I
        didn’t realize&#8212;Oh, good heavens!” with a sudden burst of agonized
        incoherence, “here he is! He’s coming and that will be the end of me.”
      </p>
      <p>Celia turned. Against the bright background of the depot entrance she
        saw the Frenchman’s thick-set figure coming rapidly down the steps. He
        had got rid of the valises, and was almost running.</p>
      <p>“Quick,” she said, and turning to the waiting carriage wrenched open
        the door.</p>
      <p>“Get in,” she commanded. The terrified creature did so. She was ready
        to be dominated by any imperious will. Celia stretched her arm through
        the window, and into the little gloved hand pressed the two-franc piece,
        then cried:</p>
      <p>“You can tell the <i>cocher</i> the address when you get started. Don’t
        stop him till you get some way off. Go,” she cried to the man, “down by
        the Rue Auber&#8212;don’t waste a minute. Fly!”</p>
      <p>The <i>cocher</i> flicked his horse with the whip, and it started. At
        the window a pale face appeared, and Celia heard the cry: “But your
        name, your address? I must send the money back.”</p>
      <p>“Never mind that,” cried Celia, “it isn’t mine. It’s conscience money.”
      </p>
      <p>The fiacre rolled down the street, and, plunging into the mêlée of
        vehicles, wound its way through the press to the Rue Auber. A man
        standing on the sidewalk drew the stares of the passers-by as he gazed
        blankly this way and that. A woman quietly picked her way across the
        <i>carrefour</i>, toward the station where one takes the Vaugirard
        omnibus.</p>

        THE JACK-POT</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Charles Dwight Willard</div>
      <p>There were five of us in the party&#8212;six, counting Long Tom, the
        guide. After two days’ hard climbing, which the <i>burros</i> endured
        with exemplary fortitude, we arrived at the little valley high up in the
        mountains, through which threaded the trout-stream. </p>
      <p>“Jest you all go over into the cabin there and make yourself comf’ble,
        while I ’tend to gettin’ this stuff unpacked,” said Long Tom; “there
        ain’t no one there. My pardner, he’s down below.”</p>
      <p>“The cabin appears to be two cabins,” said the colonel, as we
        approached it.</p>
      <p>“That is for economy in ridge-poles,” said the doctor; “sleeping
        apartments on one side and kitchen on the other. In the space between,
        you keep your fishing-tackle and worms.”</p>
      <p>We entered the right-hand section of the twin cabin, which proved to be
        the kitchen side. There was not much furniture&#8212;a table of hewn
        logs, a chair of bent saplings, and a rough bench.</p>
      <p>However, we did not notice such furniture as there was, for each member
        of the party, as he stepped over the high threshold, had his attention
        instantly attracted by the stove, and a brief roundelay of ejaculations
        went along the group.</p>
      <p>“Well, that staggers me,” said the stock-broker.</p>
      <p>“H’m,” said the professor, in a mysterious tone, and rubbed his chin.
      </p>
      <p>The stove was a plain, small cooking-range, rather old and rusty. The
        strange thing about it was its position. Its abbreviated legs stood upon
        large cedar posts, which were planted in the floor and were over four
        feet in height. This brought the stove away up in mid-air, so that the
        top was about on a level with the face of the colonel, and he was a
        six-footer.</p>
      <p>We formed in a circle about the stove and stared at it as solemnly as a
        group of priests around a sacrificial tripod. We felt of the
        posts&#8212;they were firm and solid, showing that the mysterious
        arrangement was a permanent, not a temporary, one. Then we all bent our
        necks and opened our mouths to look up at the hole in the roof, through
        which the stove-pipe vanished.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the stock-broker burst out into a laugh.</p>
      <p>“Oh, I understand it now,” said he.</p>
      <p>“Understand what?” asked the colonel, sharply.</p>
      <p>“Why Long Tom has his stove hoisted up so high from the floor.”</p>
      <p>“So do I,” said the doctor; “but I suspect that my explanation is not
        the same that any one else would offer.”</p>
      <p>“Well, I will bet that I am right,” said the stock-broker, “and put up
        the money.”</p>
      <p>“I am in this,” said the judge; “I have a clear idea about that stove
        and will back it.”</p>
      <p>“Make it a jack-pot,” said the colonel; “I want to take a hand.” </p>
      <p>The stock-broker drew a small yellow coin out of his pocket and dropped
        it on the table.</p>
      <p>“He has the stove up there,” he said, “to get a better draught. In this
        rarefied mountain air there is only a small amount of oxygen to the
        cubic inch, and combustion is more difficult to secure than in the lower
        latitudes. I have heard that if you get high enough up, you can’t cook
        an egg&#8212;that is, I mean, water won’t boil&#8212;or something like
        that,” he continued, thrown into sudden confusion by the discovery that
        the professor’s eye was fixed upon him with a sarcastic gaze.</p>
      <p>“Is that supposed to be science?” demanded the professor.</p>
      <p>“Well,” said the stock-broker, doggedly, “never mind the reasons.
        Experience is probably good enough for Long Tom. He finds that he gets a
        better draught for his stove by having it up in mid-air, so he has it
        there.”</p>
      <p>“The right explanation,” began the professor, “is the simplest. My idea
        is that&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>“Excuse me,” interrupted the stock-broker, tapping the table; “are you
        in this pot?”</p>
      <p>The professor made a deposit, and proceeded:</p>
      <p>“Have you noticed that our host is a very tall man? Like most men of
        his height, he hates to bend over. If the stove were near the floor, he
        would have to stoop down low when he whirled a flap-jack or speared a
        rasher of bacon. Now he can stand up and do it with ease. Your draught
        theory is no good; the longer the pipe, if it is straight, the better
        the fire will burn.”</p>
      <p>“Professor,” remarked the colonel, “I regret to have to tell you that
        your money is gone. Long Tom told me, on the way up, that his partner
        did all the cooking, and he is a man of rather short stature.” The
        colonel then paid his compliments to the jack-pot, and continued: “Now,
        my idea is that the stove heats the room better there than on the floor.
        It is only a cooking-stove, to be sure, but when the winter is cold it
        makes this room comfortable. Being up in the middle of the space, it
        heats it all equally well, which it could not do if it were down below.”
      </p>
      <p>The doctor greeted this theory with a loud laugh. “Colonel,” he said,
        “you are wild&#8212;way off the mark. Hot air rises, of course, and the
        only way to disseminate it is to have your stove as low as possible.
        According to your idea, it would be a good plan to put the furnace in
        the attic of a house instead of in the basement.” </p>
      <p>“I think,” said the colonel, “that I could appreciate your argument
        better if you would ante.”</p>
      <p>“The pot is mine,” said the doctor, as he deposited his coin; “you will
        all adopt my idea the moment you hear it, and Long Tom, who will be here
        in a minute, will bear me out. This room is very small; it has but
        little floor-space, and none of it goes to waste. Now, if he had put the
        stove down where we expected to find it, Long Tom could not have made
        use of the area underneath, as you see he has done. On all sides of the
        supporting posts, you will notice there are hooks, on which he hangs his
        pans and skillets. Underneath, there is a kitchen-closet for pots and
        cooking-utensils of various sorts. What could be more convenient? Under
        your ordinary stove there is room only for a poker and a few
        cockroaches.”</p>
      <p>The judge, who had been listening to the opinions offered by the others
        with the same grim smile that occasionally ornamented his face when he
        announced that an objection was overruled, now stepped forward and
        dropped a coin on the table. He then rendered his decision as follows:
      </p>
      <p>“It appears that none of you have noticed the forest of hooks in the
        roof just over the stove. They are not in use at present, but they are
        there for some purpose. I imagine that during the winter huge pieces of
        venison and bear’s-meat dangle over the stove, and are dried for use
        later. Now, if the stove were on the floor, it would be too far from the
        roof to be of service in this way.”</p>
      <p>“Here comes old Tom,” shouted the colonel, who had stepped to the open
        door while the judge was speaking.</p>
      <p>The old trapper put down the various articles of baggage with which his
        arms were loaded and came into the kitchen-cabin where we all stood. He
        glanced at the group and then at the stilted stove in our midst.</p>
      <p>“I see you air all admirin’ my stove,” said he, “and I’ll bet you’ve
        been a-wonderin’ why it is up so high.”</p>
      <p>“Yes, we have,” said the professor; “how did you know it?”</p>
      <p>“People most allus generally jest as soon as they come into the place
        begin to ask me about it&#8212;that’s how I knowed.”</p>
      <p>“Well, why is it up so high?” demanded the stock-broker impatiently,
        with a side glance at the well-developed jack-pot on the table.</p>
      <p>“The reason’s simple enough,” said Long Tom, with a grin that showed
        his bicuspids; “you see we had to pack all this stuff up here from down
        below on <i>burros</i>. Originally there was four j’ints of that
        stove-pipe, but the cinch wasn’t drawed tight enough on the <i>burro</i>
        that was carryin’’em, and two of’em slipped out and rolled down the
        mountain. When we got here and found that there wasn’t but two pieces
        left, I reckoned that I would have to kinder h’ist the stove to make it
        fit the pipe&#8212;so I jest in an’ h’isted her. And thar she is yet.
        Say, what’s all this here money on the table for?”</p>
      <p>There was a deep silence which lasted so long that Tom ventured to
        repeat his question about the money.</p>
      <p>“It is a jack-pot,” said the doctor, sadly, “and as near as I can make
        out, it belongs to you.”</p>

      <p>“Thou hast the writings of Le Toy, Wau Shun?” asked Sam Lee of his
        brother-highbinder, as the latter issued from the receiving hospital of
        San Francisco.</p>
      <p>“Verily, or thou hadst heard my dogs bark within,” replied Wau Shun.
      </p>
      <p>“And Lee Toy?”</p>
      <p>“Lee Toy died babbling of wings, and of the white babe whose life he
        saved from fire this day at the price of his own, and whose father stood
        beside him weeping like a woman.”</p>
      <p>“Was ever the like seen before!” exclaimed Sam Lee. “That Lee Toy, the
        bravest of the brave, the keenest hatchet of our ‘tong,’ should fail his
        brethren, and break his oaths, and worship the white babe whose
        abduction he had undertaken&#8212;and that the babe’s father should weep
        for one of our people!”</p>
      <p>“Ay, and, what is of more importance, that Lee Toy should have given me
        the writings that would have hanged us, who compassed his passing! Eh,
        Sam Lee?” </p>
      <p>“Yea, Wau Shun; and compassed also the hanging of Quong Lung&#8212;nay,
        turn not so suddenly in a narrow lane, my brother, for I have but one
        eye, as thou knowest, and that can not abide swift movement in the dark
        on the part of a man whose life is forfeit”; and Sam Lee drew a darkling
        revolver from his blouse.</p>
      <p>With a deft movement, Wau Shun, who had the advantage of two
        eyes&#8212;though they looked in different directions and were hard to
        meet&#8212;threw Sam Lee’s hand up, and snatched the pistol from him.
      </p>
      <p>“’Twere easy to slay thee now, Sam Lee; and ’twere profitable,
        too&#8212;if only Quong Lung were out of the way.”</p>
      <p>“Ay, if Quong Lung were only out of the way; but Quong Lung lives and
        waxes fat, and Wau Shun is his slave!”</p>
      <p>No more was said. They turned into a narrow alley near the top of
        Jackson Street, Wau Shun walking in the rear. As soon as they had
        entered the shadow produced by the narrowness of the lane and by its
        angle to the lighted main street, there was a sharp report, and Sam Lee
        fell on his face, and coughed like one who is stricken through the
        lungs.</p>
      <p>The swarms that inhabit Chinatown began to buzz. In a few minutes the
        alley was crowded with curious coolies jabbering excitedly, and in the
        fifth or sixth row of those who stood round Sam Lee was Wau Shun,
        watching the blood that welled from the mouth of the dying man and
        prevented speech.</p>
      <p>After Wau Shun had seen the corpse of his brother-highbinder laid out
        on a slab at the morgue, he treated himself to a couple of jorums of
        “hot-Scotch,” and sought his den in Cum Cook Alley.</p>
      <p>Lighting a dim candle, he proceeded to barricade himself, and to
        conceal his light, by means of a coverlet that was held in its place, on
        his side of the door, by iron bars that crossed and recrossed each
        other.</p>
      <p>When all was snug, he drew from an inner pocket the roll of papers
        given to him by Lee Toy, which set forth the names of the several
        highbinders who belonged to his “tong,” the various loppings
        accomplished by their “hatchets,” and, in a special supplement, the
        instigations to certain notorious crimes by their master-mind, Quong
        Lung.</p>
      <p>Lighting a brazier, he tore out his own record from the writing, and
        committed it to the flames. But that which related to Quong Lung he
        placed in a receptacle cunningly concealed in the threshold of the door.
      </p>
      <p>Then, extinguishing his light, he sallied forth with the rest of Lee
        Toy’s confessions in his pocket, to speak with Quong Lung, who had
        awaited him these many hours with patience&#8212;and wrath.</p>
      <div class='tac mt07'>II.</div>
      <p class='sc tac mb05'> The Lesser Discipline.</p>
      <p>The dawn of Christmas Day was rosy when Wau Shun reached Quong Lung’s
        store. The bells throughout the city of San Francisco were once more
        frantically announcing the birth of the Babe of Bethlehem, as Wau Shun
        gave the signal of “The Brethren” on Quong Lung’s electric bell. It was
        answered by a deep voice that came through a speaking-tube, the end of
        which was so cleverly hidden that none but the initiated could find it:
        “Peace attend thy feet! What brother needs succor?” </p>
      <p>“Thy servant, Wau Shun.”</p>
      <p>“Enter, Wau Shun,” and the door was opened by some mechanical
        contrivance, and closed, as soon as Wau Shun had crossed the threshold,
        with a snap suggestive of a steel trap. Pressing a concealed button, Wau
        Shun lit an incandescent lamp that showed him how to avoid the thread,
        the breaking of which would have precipitated a hundred-weight of iron
        on the head of an intruder. At the end of the passage thus illuminated
        was a door, to which he applied his pass-key and entered an apartment
        that was a reflex of its occupant, in whom East and West were met. The
        room was decorated and furnished in accordance with the tastes of a
        Chinese gentleman of high culture; but the illumination was supplied by
        electricity, and a long-distance telephone, of the latest pattern, stood
        at the elbow of the stout, spectacled Chinese merchant, who sat on a
        great ebony chair, gravely smoking a cigar.</p>
      <p>This was Quong Lung, the famous head of the high-binders of the See
        Yups&#8212;the most powerful “tong” in San Francisco&#8212;and who owed
        his bad preëminence to the fact that he was absolutely unscrupulous,
        using even his devoted friends as stepping-stones to his ambitions.
        Then, too, he was a “Native Son of the Golden West,” and used the idioms
        and swore with the ease of a born Californian. He had friends&#8212;old
        school-fellows and college chums&#8212;among the executive of San
        Francisco, and, by means of his more intimate knowledge of what was
        happening, he was enabled to humiliate his rivals and punish his
        enemies.</p>
      <p>“Thou hast done well, Wau Shun,” he began, “and deservest
        well&#8212;but dry tongues can not speak.”</p>
      <p>Pouring out some whisky for himself, he pushed the bottle across to Wau
        Shun, who had now seated himself on the other side of the table. </p>
      <p>“Thy servant is enriched by thy approbation, Most Powerful,” replied
        Wau Shun, draining his glass after Quong Lung had drunk.</p>
      <p>“The passing of Lee Toy by way of fire was excellently done, Wau
        Shun&#8212;most excellently done. And where is Sam Lee?”</p>
      <p>“He is aweary and sleepeth, Great Master,” answered Wau Shun, whose
        squinting was suddenly accentuated.</p>
      <p>“May his sleep refresh him! But the end of Lee Toy, as I have already
        said, was surpassingly excellent, Wau Shun. I learnt by this”&#8212;and
        Quong Lung pointed with his cigar to the telephone&#8212;“I learnt by
        this of the firing of the house of the white devil, whose babe Lee Toy
        guarded, and how Lee Toy died to save the devilkin.”</p>
      <p>“Ho, ho, ho!” interrupted Wau Shun, chuckling softly, and helping
        himself again from the bottle.</p>
      <p>“And the writings of Lee Toy?” asked Quong Lung, after a while.</p>
      <p>Without a word Wau Shun laid a packet on the table.</p>
      <p>“But these pertain to Sam Lee only,” exclaimed Quong Lung, after he had
        examined the roll of papers; and his nostrils dilated slightly. “Thou
        hast, doubtless, others that relate to thee and to me.”</p>
      <p>“Now, nay, All-Seeing; the packet is as Lee Toy gave it to me&#8212;so
        Sam Lee will tell thee.”</p>
      <p>“If the dead may speak,” said Quong Lung, deliberately.</p>
      <p>The other turned toward him with amazement and horror in his looks. It
        was admirably done, but it did not even attract the attention of Quong
        Lung, who quietly flicked the ash from his cigar, and went on: “And thou
        wast seen by two of our brethren in the crowd that witnessed the end of
        Sam Lee; and ’twere easy, too, to find witnesses who saw thee slay Sam
        Lee.” Then, after a pause, he went on: “Moreover, only fools tell lies
        to such as me. None may sit on that chair and lie to me&#8212;only lift
        not thy voice at the proof of it, lest death come to thee suddenly!”</p>
      <p>The next moment the horror-stricken highbinder was writhing under the
        spell of an electric current, strong enough to prevent him from relaxing
        his hold on the arms of his chair, which he had grasped as he tried to
        spring to his feet.</p>
      <p>After Quong Lung had disarmed his victim, he said: “Thou wilt be here
        two days hence, and at the same hour, with the other writings of Lee
        Toy! Two of thy brethren await thee on the street, and will see to thy
        punctuality. Drink once more, Wau Shun, thou hast need. Ho, ho!”</p>
      <div class='tac mt07'>III.</div>
      <p class='sc tac mb05'> Sweet Counsel and “Black Smoke.” </p>
      <p>“Roast turkey, cranberry sauce, mince pies, plum pudding,
        cheese-straws, a choice between beer and champagne! Well, Quong Lung,
        and what do you want of me, you prince of plotters?”</p>
      <p>The speaker had all the outward and visible signs of one who was a
        slave to opium; but under the influence of Quong Lung’s Christmas dinner
        his eyes sparkled and his spirits rose to a high pitch.</p>
      <p>“Nothing, nothing, Jim&#8212;at least nothing to speak of; and we won’t
        speak of it until we have had a small black coffee, and&#8212;a small
        black pipe. By the way,” he went on, “Miss Ah Moy and Miss Shun Sen will
        come in presently with the coffee and pipes.” </p>
      <p>Quong Lung’s guest, James Ray, was lank, and sallow, and of uncertain
        age, because of his terrible vice, and his hair was prematurely gray. He
        had been an electrical engineer of high promise until he became an
        opium-fiend. Even his clothes betrayed his failing, no less than his
        scanty and feeble beard and mustache and his leaden complexion. He had
        attended the same Eastern college as Quong Lung, and had imbued the
        latter with a taste for Shakespeare and Byron and the Psalms of David;
        together they had graduated from Yale; and then Quong Lung, recognizing
        the ability of his friend and the possibilities of electricity in the
        career of a highbinder, had introduced Ray to the fascination of
        opium-smoking; and so&#8212;through the uses of adversity&#8212;he held
        the latter in pawn for his own nefarious ends.</p>
      <p>“Why all this magnificence, Quong Lung?” inquired Ray, after Ah Moy and
        her colleague had brought in the coffee and the implements pertaining to
        “black smoke.” “You have but to say the word, old man, and, like Ariel,
        ‘I’ll put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.’”</p>
      <p>Now the hiring of Ah Moy and Shun Sen to twang their <i>samyens</i> for
        the delectation of white devils, and hand them coffee and sing to them,
        “came high,” for the damsels were famous in their way and in great
        demand.</p>
      <p>“This is too small a thing for you to notice, Jim,” replied Quong Lung;
        “nothing is too good for my friend.”</p>
      <p>“Why didn’t you add, ‘the earth is my lord’s and the fullness thereof,’
        and crush me with your compliments? As though I were a damned coolie!”
      </p>
      <p>There was some petulance in Ray’s voice, as he gave way to the feeble
        irritability that attends the constant use of narcotics and stimulants
        by all except Orientals. He rose to his elbow from the mat on which he
        was smoking, and threw the pipe on its tray, like a spoiled child. But
        Quong Lung took no notice of the little outbreak, and Ah Moy put the
        pipe to his lips with her own fair hands and soon coaxed him into
        complacency. When a look of contentment had once more settled on his
        face, Ray said, deprecatingly: “It was the ‘dope’ that spoke, Quong
        Lung, and not I; forgive me, old man! And now, what do you want?”</p>
      <p>Quong Lung motioned to the girls to withdraw, and when he was alone
        with Ray he said: “Jim, I shall hang unless you help me.”</p>
      <p>“You must be in a bad fix, indeed, Quong Lung, if you depend on my
        small arts to help you. Explain.”</p>
      <p>“Certain papers implicating me are in the possession of one of my
        blood-hounds, who has shown himself recalcitrant and
        ungrateful&#8212;the damned dog! By means of the battery yonder, which
        you rigged up for me, I frightened the brute considerably this morning,
        and he will be here again two nights hence with such of the papers as
        his fears may compel him to part with; but if his courage should revive,
        as it may, and if he should come without the documents, I want to put
        him under the stress of telling me where they are to be found, and then
        I desire that he should never speak again!”</p>
      <p>Quong Lung darted a look full of dangerous meaning at Ray.</p>
      <p>“Why don’t you employ your regular bull-dogs to attend to this
        unpleasant affair, Quong Lung?”</p>
      <p>“Because their methods are coarse and their weapons clumsy.”</p>
      <p>“But it is deuced risky to be an accessory before the fact in a murder
        case, my friend.”</p>
      <p>“No, no, Jim, not murder! Call it, rather, ‘the sudden death of an
        unknown coolie, from unknown causes.’”</p>
      <p>“And the consideration for me?”</p>
      <p>“Two hundred dollars now,” said Quong Lung, laying a pile of notes on
        the platform on which they were smoking, “and two hundred more after the
        thing is over.”</p>
      <p>“And if I refuse?”</p>
      <p>Quong Lung shrugged his shoulders, and said, in an indifferent tone of
        voice: “Life without opium, and without means of obtaining it, were
        hell, as you know. Besides, so many accidents are constantly happening
        in Chinatown.” </p>
      <p>“Very well,” replied the other, rising languidly to his feet and
        thrusting the notes into his pocket; “very well. You must let me have
        entire possession of this room for the next two days, and provide such
        assistance and implements as I may require.”</p>
      <p>As he was leaving the room he stopped to smell a tuberose that stood on
        a bamboo flower-stand. The passing act seemed to give him an idea, for
        he turned suddenly to Quong Lung, saying: “See to it, Quong Lung, that
        you provide plenty of punk-sticks for the eventful night. You will need
        them, I am thinking. And be good to this green brother,” pointing to the
        tuberose. </p>
      <div class='tac mt07'>IV.</div>
      <p class='sc tac mb05'>Concerning Cherries and Tuberoses.</p>
      <p>An hour before the time set for the arrival of Wau Shun, Ray called
        Quong Lung into the room wherein he had labored almost incessantly
        during the past two days.</p>
      <p>“All’s done,” he said, “save only the payment of my dues.”</p>
      <p>“Proceed,” returned Quong Lung, laying ten double eagles on the table
        and seating himself on his favorite ebony chair.</p>
      <p>Ray eyed him curiously while he pocketed the money, and the Chinaman,
        who seemed to notice everything, rose quickly from the chair and said,
        with a smile:</p>
      <div class='poetry-container'>
        <div class='poetry'>
          <div class='stanza'>
            <div class='verse'>“‘How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds,
            </div>
            <div class='verse'>Makes ill deeds done!’</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class='ni'>Eh Jim? Now show me your trick.”</p>
      <p>“Should somebody you dislike sit on the chair you have just left, Quong
        Lung, pressure on this button”&#8212;pointing to an innocent-looking
        cherry painted on a panel that hung on the wall&#8212;“would connect the
        chair with the electric-light wires that pass over your house, and make
        your objectionable guest the recipient of&#8212;say, three thousand
        volts.”</p>
      <p>“And then?”</p>
      <p>“And then&#8212;slightly altering the words of your favorite poet, to
        describe the result&#8212;‘his heart would once heave, and forever stand
        still’; and nobody would know how your highbinder died.”</p>
      <p>As Ray left the room, he was again attracted to the tuberose. After
        smelling it, he turned round and called to Quong Lung, saying: “But you
        will not leave this innocent in the room, Quong Lung; its odor would be
        ruined by the punks you will burn, and by other savors.” </p>
      <p>Then gravely saluting Quong Lung, James Ray left the Chinaman’s house,
        and made his way to the office of the chief of police of San Francisco,
        for even a dope-fiend has a fragmentary conscience.</p>
      <div class='tac mt07'>V.</div>
      <p class='sc tac mb05'>The Greater Discipline.</p>
      <p>While Ray told his story to the chief of police, with all the
        circumstances and detail that would exonerate him and implicate Quong
        Lung, the latter met Wau Shun at his outer door, and, holding him by the
        hand, escorted him to his chamber, which was dim with the smoke of many
        burning punks, the odor of which filled the air.</p>
      <p>“Those who are true to me, Wau Shun, will always find that my ‘ways are
        ways of pleasantness, and all my paths are peace,’” said Quong Lung,
        softly, misquoting the Psalmist.</p>
      <p>“Thy house, Far Reacher, is the well-known dwelling of pleasantness and
        peace.”</p>
      <p>When Quong Lung would have seated Wau Shun on the chair of which the
        highbinder had such a lively recollection, the coolie shook his head,
        saying: “Nay, who is thy slave that he should sit in the presence of the
        Most Powerful. The ground thou treadest is good enough for him.” And Wau
        Shun squatted on the floor before his chief.</p>
      <p>“There is no harm in the chair, Wau Shun,” said Quong Lung, seating
        himself on it carelessly, “no harm unless, indeed, the sitter tells lies
        or have deceit in his heart.” Then, after a pause, he went on: “The
        writings of Lee Toy&#8212;thou hast brought them?”</p>
      <p>“Of a surety,” replied Wau Shun, producing a packet of papers from his
        blouse.</p>
      <p>After Quong Lung had looked through them, and satisfied himself that
        they were authentic and complete, he said: “Wau Shun, the white devils
        say that virtue is its own reward; but that would be poor reward for
        such virtuous actions as thine. Thou shalt drink with me first, and then
        expound to me how I may lighten the burden of obligations thou hast laid
        on me.”</p>
      <p>He went to the table, and pouring out two glasses of spirits, he
        advanced with them on a tray to the squatting coolie.</p>
      <p>After they had drunk, Quong Lung resumed his seat, and lighting a
        cigar, he said: “It is not meet that he who hath saved my life this day
        should crouch on the ground like a dog. Let Wau Shun take my own
        particular chair, whereon none have sat save those I would
        honor&#8212;nay, I insist”; and Quong Lung pointed to the great chair of
        ebony, broad enough to accommodate two men such as himself. It was
        adorned with a shield of bronze, richly carved and inlaid, that formed
        its back; and it stood on a dais of burnished copper, and might have
        been the throne of an Oriental potentate; and behind it was a mirror
        which reflected the exquisite carving on its back. </p>
      <p>When Wau Shun, after much protestation, had ensconced himself in a
        corner of the great chair, Quong Lung once more filled the glasses, and
        again they drank in silence.</p>
      <p>“And now, Wau Shun, though I can not weigh my gold against thy services
        to me, yet, I pray thee, name some reward that will not put me to shame
        to bestow on thee.”</p>
      <p>“Will the payment of fifty dollars afflict thee, my lord?”</p>
      <p>“Nay, Wau Shun, that is the due of but a part of thy merits&#8212;the
        slaying of Sam Lee, for instance. Here is more for thy other many good
        deeds,” and Quong Lung tossed on the table a heavy bag that chinked
        opulently. “Moreover,” he continued, “now that Lee Toy, our keenest
        hatchet, is dead, some worthy successor to him must be found, and who so
        worthy as Wau Shun, the slayer of the uncommon slain, Lee Toy?”</p>
      <p>“Further, Instigator,” interrupted Wau Shun, squinting atrociously, for
        the liquor had begun to mount to his head; “further, it seems to me that
        if anything happened to thee&#8212;which God forbid!&#8212;<i>I</i>
        might be found worthy to sit in this thy chair by reason of thy
        recommendation, and&#8212;my worthiness.”</p>
      <p>“Of course, of course,” said Quong Lung, looking at the point of his
        cigar and crossing his knees. “The See Yups have need of strong men, and
        who so strong as Wau Shun! Drink once more to thy worthiness.”</p>
      <p>After they had disposed of the liquor and smoked awhile, Wau Shun said,
        familiarly and half-insolently: “Quong Lung, thou owest me reparation
        for thy insults of two nights ago; and seeing thou art seated on the
        chair of humiliation” (here Wau Shun lapsed into impudent vernacular),
        “you must needs do as I say or be twisted out of shape.”</p>
      <p>“What!” exclaimed Quong Lung, putting one hand carelessly behind his
        head and resting the other against the adjacent wall, whereon was a
        painted panel that glowed with cherries&#8212;“what! wouldst thou plague
        me?” </p>
      <p>“Nay, but I would discipline you,” said Wau Shun, thickly; “I would
        discipline you with cramps, if need were.”</p>
      <p>“And cramps only?” asked Quong Lung, toying with the flower-painted
        panel. “’Twere dangerous to play with me so lightly. Cramps can not
        touch me and are for fools alone.”</p>
      <p>“Then I would kill you otherwise, smooth, fat hog!”</p>
      <p>“Have at thee, Wau Shun!” exclaimed Quong Lung, fiercely, pressing the
        fatal cherry; and Wau Shun, sitting in the corner of the gorgeous chair,
        stiffened into a frightful attitude, and then began writhing dreadfully.
        To the heavy, punk-laden atmosphere of the room was added an odor of
        burning flesh.</p>
      <p>Quong Lung rose from his seat and crossed the room to where his victim
        was being electrocuted. “Ho, ho, ho!” he laughed softly; “excellent Jim,
        most excellent Jim!”</p>
      <p>As he watched the grim murder enacting before him, he saw, reflected in
        the mirror behind the chair of doom, the door that led into the room
        slowly open, and James Ray and a detective well known to Quong Lung
        entered swiftly.</p>
      <p>“Throw up your hands, Quong Lung!” commanded the officer, as he covered
        the Chinaman with his pistol.</p>
      <p>Taken in the midst of his crime, Quong Lung started and, backing
        against the fatal chair, he fell on the seat beside his victim, with a
        yell, as the tremendous current shot through him, killing him instantly.
      </p>
      <p>“Turn off the current, Ray. For God’s sake, be quick!” shouted the
        officer, as the bodies writhed and twisted on the chair of death. </p>
      <p>“Yes, yes,” came the leisurely reply, as Ray took the tuberose from the
        flower-stand; “there will be plenty of time after I have removed this
        sweet tenderling from this horrible atmosphere.”</p>

        title='A Double Shot'>A DOUBLE SHOT</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Stewart Edward White</div>
      <p>Pat McCann came up from the plains into the hills in a bad humor with
        himself and the world. He had tried to be a cow-puncher and had been
        promptly bucked off; he had tackled the cooking problem and only escaped
        mobbing by resigning his job; now he had dragged his little, squab form,
        with its hanging arms, up into the hills to try mining. He applied to
        the first camp he came to. King, the foreman, gave him a job.</p>
      <p>Early the next morning he and another man walked down the gulch through
        the sarvis bushes for half a mile, turned abruptly to the right, climbed
        the uneven length of a zigzag trail, and at last halted near the top of
        a ridge. The pine trees, slim and tall, grew out of the unevenly
        carpeted ground, through which cropped irregular slices of a red-brown,
        crumbling rock. At the very crest was a dark-gray “dike” of quartzite,
        standing up steep and castellated for a height of thirty feet or more.
        This was the “hanging wall” of the prospective mine. Down through the
        trees were glimpses of vast, breathless descents to other ridges and
        other pines far below. Over the dike was nothing but the blue sky.</p>
      <p>The two men had stopped within a hundred feet of the top. The old hand
        went over to a rough lean-to of small trees covering a rude forge, from
        beneath which he drew several steel drills of various lengths and a
        sledge-hammer, which he carried to a scar in the face of a huge
        outcropping rock. After dumping these he returned and got a can of water
        and a long T-shaped implement of iron. The two men then set to work.</p>
      <p>McCann held firmly while the other struck. After each blow he would
        half-turn the drill. When a dozen strokes had been given, he poured a
        little water in the hole, and thrust the drill through a bit of sacking
        to keep it from splashing. The other man jammed his hat down closely
        over his forehead and struck fiercely, alternately breathing in and
        grunting in rhythmical succession. When the hole became clogged with
        fine, gray mud, McCann carefully spooned it out with the T-shaped
        instrument, wiping the latter each time on his trousers. While he did
        this his companion leaned on his sledge or threw chunks of rock, with
        wonderful accuracy, at the squirrels that ran continually back and forth
        on the ridge. As the hole grew deeper, longer drills were used, until at
        last the longest of all left barely enough above the surface of the rock
        to afford a hand-hold. With that the miner expressed himself satisfied.
        He then brought three cylindrical packages wrapped in greasy paper.</p>
      <p>“What’s them?” McCann inquired.</p>
      <p>The miner grunted contemptuously.</p>
      <p>“Hercules powder,” he replied. He pronounced the proper name in two
        syllables.</p>
      <p>With a sharp knife he cut these into lengths of about three inches
        each, and dropped them one by one into the hole in the rock. He then
        rammed them home with a hickory ramrod, just as all old miners will
        insist on doing. Because of this a large percentage of old miners have
        no fore and middle fingers on their right hands. The last piece he
        split, inserted in the crack a bit of fuse, on the end of which was a
        copper cap, dropped it in, and then carefully chinked-in with the wet
        grit which had been spooned out of the hole.</p>
      <p>“Mosey for cover, Irish!” he said, and touched it off.</p>
      <p>From behind his tree McCann saw the sputtering fuse disappear. The next
        instant the rock seemed to bulge, splitting in radiation as it did so,
        and then the smoke belched forth in a canopy, filled with fragments of
        quartz. Following the miner, he found a jagged opening in the rock. Then
        they sharpened their drills at the forge and went at it again. By night
        they had fired two more blasts, and had made a start toward a shaft.
        After the third, Bob, the miner, said, glancing at the West: “That’ll
        do, Irish.”</p>
      <p>They <i>caçhed</i> the tools, caught up the water-bucket, and swung
        rapidly down the trail. Bob was ahead, slouching along with the
        mountaineer’s peculiar gait, which seems so lazy, and yet which gets
        over the ground so fast. In a very few moments he reached the gulch
        below, plunging from the bare, rock-strewn hillside under the pines to
        the lush grasses and cool saplings of the cañon bed, as from a desert to
        a garden. He looked around to say something. McCann was gone.</p>
      <p>“Well, I’m damned!” he ejaculated, and yelled loudly.</p>
      <p>After a moment’s pause, from far down the opposite slope came a faint
        whoop. Bob sat down on a fallen tree, and waited philosophically,
        shouting at intervals. In a little while the Irishman came charging
        frantically up the gulch, tearing along through the vines and bushes at
        full speed, so terrified that he passed within ten feet of Bob without
        seeing him. The latter watched him surge by with an odd little twinkle
        in his eye. Then suddenly he shouted again. Pat slowed up, looked about
        for a moment vacantly, and then his rugged Hibernian face broke into a
        multitude of jolly wrinkles.</p>
      <p>“Arrah, it’s yerself, darlin,” he said; “Oi thought it’s Pat McCann as
        is goin’ t’ slape wid th’ mountain lines this night!”</p>
      <p>“You stick t’ me,” was Bob’s only comment.</p>
      <p>After a short climb the men reached the camp on a knoll overlooking two
        confluent gulches. There was the superintendent’s office, the
        cook-house, the bunkhouse, the blacksmith’s shop, the stables, and the
        corral&#8212;all of logs. Supper was served at sundown. The men filed
        in, took off their coats, and sat down without a word. As each one
        finished eating, he arose, put on his coat again, and sauntered outside,
        filling his pipe as he went. Finally the whole gang was gathered at the
        bunk-house, smoking, telling laconic stories, or playing
        cribbage&#8212;the great American game in the mountains.</p>
      <p>As the last comer, Pat was told to water the horses. He went boldly
        into the corral with a rope, and was kicked flat. The boys straightened
        him out, and, after he had regained his breath, gave two of the horses’
        halters into his hands. Except in the main cañons of the Black Hills
        there is no surface water, the creeks all running down along the
        bed-rock. As a consequence, wells are necessary even in the upper hills.
        Pat first let a horse get loose, then he lost the bucket down the well,
        then he fell in himself in trying to fish it out. The boys fished him
        out with some interest. So manifestly inadequate an individual it had
        not been their fortune to meet before, and they looked on him as a
        curiosity. On the spot they adopted Pat McCann much as they would have
        adopted a stray kitten or puppy, and doubtless in somewhat the same
        amused, tolerant state of mind.</p>
      <p>The next morning Bob and Pat cleared away the <i>débris</i> of the
        three blasts, wrenching off the broken, adhering bits with a pick, and
        shoveling them out. King came up with an axe-gang and built a rough,
        square breastwork of logs down the hill, to catch the quartz as in a
        bin. They also squared a number of timbers, and tongued the ends. These
        were to timber the shaft. </p>
      <p>All this interested the little Irishman. He recovered his spirits, and
        his Old World blarney came back to him. The clear, fresh air of the
        hills, the abundant food, the hard work, the sound sleep, the reaction
        against the taciturnity of the men, and the calm grandeur of the
        mountains, filled him with animal spirits. He imagined he had found his
        vocation at last. He wanted to do everything. In time he learned to
        strike with the sledge, although it was only after long practice on a
        stake that he could induce any one to “hold” for him; he sharpened
        drills&#8212;after a fashion; he even helped in the timbering-up. The
        only thing lacking was the “shooting” of the charges. He had an ambition
        to touch the thing off. This King roughly forbade.</p>
      <p>“That fly-away fool to risk his neck that way?” he said; “I guess not!
        He don’t know enough now to make his head ache. When I want a wild
        Irishman too dead to skin, I’ll let you know. I don’t want that man to
        have the first thing to do with the powder. Understand that!” </p>
      <p>What King said went in that camp. Besides, the men knew him to be in
        the right. Pat was the unluckiest man alive, and the most awkward. He
        was sure to be in any trouble there was about&#8212;in fact, as Jack
        Williams said, he was a sort of lightning-rod for the whole camp in the
        way of trouble; every one else was sure of exemption, if there was only
        one man’s share of difficulty dealt out. So McCann pleaded in vain.</p>
      <p>This went to his heart. He would have given his black-thorn shillalah
        from Dublin to have been looked upon as a full-fledged miner. He used to
        put on all the airs of one in Sweetwater when he went down there once a
        week, swaggering about in copper-riveted jeans, with his hat on one
        side, conversing learnedly though vaguely on “blow-outs,” “horses,”
        “foot-walls,” and other technicalities, hauling out of his pockets
        yellow-flecked bits of quartz&#8212;in short, “putting on dog” to an
        amazing extent. But as he turned past the stamp-mill of the Great Snake
        and began to scale the heart-breaking trail that led to the top of the
        ridge, his crest began to fall. As he followed the narrow, level summit
        for the three miles of its length, standing as it were in the very
        blueness of the air, his spirits began to evaporate. When he took the
        shorter and gentler descent to the camp, the old conviction had returned
        with sickening force. He was not a miner. He had never “shot.” He used
        all his persuasive powers in vain. For one thing, the men were afraid to
        disobey King. For another, they liked Pat, and, having a firm faith in
        his “hoodoo,” were convinced that his “shooting” and sudden death would
        be synonymous terms. So Pat abandoned persuasion and tried craft.</p>
      <p>The old shaft on which he and Bob had first begun work had been carried
        down fifty feet. Appropriate cross-cuts and drifts had been made to
        exploit the lead. It was now abandoned. Bob and Pat were put to work at
        another spot in the same lead a little farther along the ridge. The
        place marked out for the first blast was between two huge bowlders, or
        rather between the two rounded cheeks of one bowlder. The passage
        between them was perhaps five or six feet wide. One end led out in a
        gradual descent to the broad, open park of the ridge top, the other
        dropped off abruptly three or four feet to another level place. Around
        the corner of the first the miners kept their tools and forge; down the
        second they planned to drop when the blast was fired; and there they had
        built a little fire, it being, on that particular day, in the lee of the
        rock.</p>
      <p>The hole had been all drilled before Bob discovered that he had
        forgotten to bring any powder; so, cursing, he started down the passage
        to get some from the sheet-iron powder-house in the draw. Hardly was he
        out of sight before McCann, chuckling softly to himself, pulled from
        under a shelving bit of rock the missing powder. With this he loaded the
        hole; he arranged the fuse, and then dropped down the ledge to get a
        brand from the fire. It was nearly out, so it took a few moments to
        start a torch. However, he was in no hurry, as it was some little
        distance to the powder-house, and Bob could not possibly return inside
        of half an hour. At last he coaxed a bit of pine into a glow, and turned
        to climb back. A startling sight met his eyes.</p>
      <p>When Bob went to get the powder he stopped at the forge for the
        water-pail. As he stooped to pick it up, something struck him a sudden
        blow in the thigh that knocked him over and set the blood
        flowing&#8212;he said afterward he thought the bone was broken. When he
        could see, he looked about to find what had hit him, and discovered not
        ten feet away the long, tawny body of a puma.</p>
      <p>The great cat lay watching him through half-shut eyes, lazily switching
        its tail back and forth. From the depths of its throat came a deep
        rumbling purr. He tried to rise, but could not. Then he turned over on
        his left side and started to crawl painfully through the passageway of
        the rocks. The beast opened its eyes and followed stealthily, step after
        step, still switching its tail, and still purring. It was in a sportive
        mood, and played with its prey, as a cat plays with a mouse. Inch by
        inch the man pulled himself along, leaving a trail of blood. At last,
        within a few feet of the ledge, he stopped; he could go no further. The
        puma, too, paused.</p>
      <p>At this moment Pat McCann, a blazing pine-brand in his hand, looked
        over the ledge. Bob saw him and faintly warned him back. The puma saw
        him too. The purring ceased, and the lithe muscles tightened under the
        skin. The game was over. The animal was preparing to make its spring.
      </p>
      <p>It did not occur to the little Irishman’s fighting soul to retreat. His
        comical features stiffened; his little blue eyes fairly snapped. Slowly
        he drew himself up on the ledge, keeping his eye fixed on the puma,
        until he stood erect, then he shifted his brand mechanically into his
        left hand, and drew his sheath-knife. He did not know that the fire was
        his best weapon, and Bob was too weak to tell him. The brand, held point
        downward, began to blaze. The puma’s great eyes shifted uneasily at
        this, and its muscles relaxed. It was evidently discomposed. Pat did not
        await the attack, but stepped forward, holding his knife firmly.</p>
      <p>When within a few feet of the animal, Pat hesitated and stopped. His
        nerve was still unshaken, but he did not know how to begin. The puma
        still sniffed uneasily at the blaze, but had recovered from its first
        fear, and was again gathering its powers for a spring. For a moment
        there was absolute silence, and Pat heard through the still air the
        sharp chatter of a squirrel and the clank of the ore-team’s
        whiffle-trees from the ore road far below. While he stood thus
        uncertain, the fire from the pine, having run up along the torch, began
        to burn Pat’s fingers. Without moving his head or shifting his eyes, he
        dropped it gently&#8212;plumb upon the fuse he had so carefully arranged
        a few moments before. Then he took a step backward to avoid the smoke.
        There was a splutter and a flash, then a sudden roar. The man and the
        beast were hurled violently in opposite directions, and a volcano of
        rock shot high in the air and showered down again.</p>
      <p>The axe-gang found the puma very dead and Pat very hard to revive. The
        whisky-and-water method brought him around at last. He looked hazily
        about him in evident bewilderment until his eye caught sight of the dead
        animal, and then his face lighted up with eager joy.</p>
      <p>“Glory to God, Oi’m a miner!” he shouted. “Oi’ve ‘shot’ at last!” </p>

      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Robert Duncan Milne</div>
      <p>While lounging listlessly along the sea-wall one afternoon about the
        beginning of August last&#8212;the eighth, I think it was&#8212;enjoying
        the sunshine and inhaling the sea-breeze, my attention was attracted to
        an unusual bustle and commotion on the quay of Section Two. I could see
        from where I was that considerable exertions were being made to transfer
        some heavy object from a vessel moored alongside the quay to the quay
        itself. As I got nearer I discovered by the name on the stern that the
        vessel was the whaling-bark <i>Marion</i>, and that the object which the
        crew, assisted by a number of longshoremen, were making such efforts to
        get on shore was an immense rectangular block, measuring some nine feet
        in length by about four in breadth and thickness. Had it been a block of
        granite, the men could not have worked harder, prying it with rollers
        and levers along a gangway made of a dozen or so of stout planks laid
        abreast from the ship’s deck to the quay. As, however, this object,
        whatever it was, was swathed and enveloped with a plentiful supply of
        sacking, I could form no opinion as to its nature.</p>
      <p>While standing abstractedly by, looking on and speculating as to what
        this very heavy object might be, and wondering what it could be doing
        aboard a whaler, I was tapped gently on the shoulder by somebody, and,
        looking round, my eyes rested on a heavily bearded and bronzed
        individual in pea-jacket and rough trousers, with a laughing eye, who
        said, cheerily: “What! don’t you know me?”</p>
      <p>I was certain I had never seen the man before, though something in the
        voice sounded familiar. My doubts, however, were speedily set at rest by
        this individual exclaiming: “Don’t you recollect Joe Burnham? Has a year
        made such a difference? If so, I’m glad of it. You couldn’t have paid me
        a better compliment.”</p>
      <p>“Can it be possible?” I said, in surprise, as I grasped his hand; “why,
        Joe, who would have expected to meet you coming off a whaler? And with a
        heavy beard, too!”</p>
      <p>“Why, I thought you knew all about it,” he returned, with equal
        surprise; “just wait a minute,” he added, as he turned to give some
        directions to the men who had now got the heavy object safe on shore,
        and were proceeding to hoist it upon a dray.</p>
      <p>While he was thus engaged, I recalled some circumstances which served
        to explain the unexpected and original appearance of my friend.</p>
      <p>Joe Burnham, the son of the well-known millionaire mining-man, had, I
        knew, been recommended to go abroad for change of air about a year
        before, owing to failing health arising from too intense application to
        study. This, however, was all I knew, and I had no idea that he had
        concluded to take his change of air aboard a whaler. But knowing his
        taste for scientific pursuits of any and every character, I can not say
        that I was very much surprised to meet him again as I had just done. At
        any rate, the trip had certainly been most beneficial, as he had changed
        from a sickly and rather delicate student to a hale, hearty, and robust
        man.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” he remarked, as he came back from the dray, which was now moving
        slowly off, the four sturdy horses which drew it evidently straining
        under the weight with which it was loaded, “my doctor prescribed
        absolute freedom from brain-work of any kind. He shook his head when I
        suggested Europe. There was too much, he said, to be seen in Asia, or,
        in fact, in any other quarter of the globe, to insure the perfect repose
        he thought necessary. Even a prolonged yachting excursion did not meet
        his views. That, he said, would be worse than anything else. Its very
        monotony and loneliness would drive me to cogitation. The sea part of
        it, he admitted, was capital. If a sea voyage could be combined with
        excitement and something to do&#8212;but would I work? Then some lucky
        inspiration seemed to flash across my mind, and I asked him if there
        were any objections to a whaling trip. ‘The very thing,’ he said; ‘you
        have plenty of money and can go more as a passenger than as a sailor.
        You won’t have much time to study on board <i>that</i> kind of a vessel,
        and I’ll risk all the chances you get to indulge in the study of the
        flora and fauna of the Arctic.’ And now you see how it is that I happen
        to be disembarking at the present moment from the stanch bark
        <i>Marion</i>.”</p>
      <p>“You seem to have got plenty of baggage, anyhow,” I returned, motioning
        toward the dray, which was now fast retreating in the direction of the
        city; “your share of the blubber, perhaps,” I added, banteringly; “or
        maybe specimens of the flora and fauna of the Arctic, which your doctor
        cautioned you against.”</p>
      <p>“Partly right and partly wrong,” said Burnham, sententiously and
        somewhat seriously; “you may have got nearer the truth about that queer
        parcel than you think. But this is no time or place to speak about it.
        Come up to the house to-morrow forenoon, if you have time, and I will
        show you something that will astonish you. I particularly wish you to
        come,” he added, with emphasis; “you will be amply repaid for doing so
        by what you will see. Meantime, I have something more to arrange on
        board this vessel.” So saying, he crossed the gangway and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>Next morning about ten, in accordance with my friend’s invitation, I
        ascended the steps of the Burnham mansion, rang the bell, and sent in my
        card. I was evidently expected, as the servant requested me to follow
        him, and led the way downstairs. There, in a small court-yard sacred to
        himself, and in which, together with two apartments opening thereon, my
        friend conducted his experiments, I found him in his shirt-sleeves,
        superintending the disposition of the ponderous mass which had excited
        my curiosity the day before on the sea-wall. The workmen had just
        succeeded in hoisting it on to a strong and massive trestle-work, some
        three feet from the ground, and upon this the nondescript, oblong
        package, swathed with sacking and bound with ropes, now rested.</p>
      <p>“There!” said Burnham, as he settled with the men and turned the key of
        the door leading into the ordinary court-yard of the house; “the most
        laborious part of the job is over. It was no easy matter getting the
        package up here. But now, as publicity at this stage must on every
        consideration be avoided, I must ask you to stand ready to lend me a
        hand when necessary. Better leave your coat in the laboratory or in the
        studio&#8212;which you please&#8212;you can suit yourself.”</p>
      <p>The “laboratory” and the “studio” were the respective names of the two
        rooms opening onto the court-yard where we were now standing, which was
        itself separated, as I have said, from the main court-yard of the
        building by a tolerably high wall, opposite which were the entrances and
        windows of the rooms aforesaid, which had been originally intended for
        outhouses of some sort. The other two sides of this little court-yard
        were blind-walls of the house itself. Certainly, if secrecy were the
        requisite aimed at in my friend’s enterprise, whatever it might be, a
        happier place could not have been chosen. The “laboratory” and the
        “studio,” while each opened on the court, and while there was also
        intercommunication between the rooms, differed greatly in interior
        arrangement, as well as in the uses to which they were put. The
        laboratory was fitted up with benches, tables, and shelves, littered
        with chemical, optical, electrical, and photographic apparatus,
        zoölogical and botanical specimens, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>; a perfect
        scientific chaos, in short, without a semblance of law and order. The
        studio, on the other hand, was richly and luxuriously furnished and kept
        in scrupulous order by Burnham’s own valet, who, I noticed, however, was
        not there at this time. </p>
      <p>Passing into the laboratory first, I noticed that a trestle-work
        similar to that in the court-yard stood in the centre of the floor, and
        that it was surmounted by a shallow pan of zinc, fitted at one end with
        a waste-pipe, like that of a bath-tub, leading to the gutter of the
        court. I was still further surprised to note, when I passed on into the
        studio, that the centre of that chamber also contained what might be
        termed a supplement to the trestle-work, in that the furniture had been
        moved to one side to make room for an improvised table on which rested
        an ordinary mattress. In addition to this a bureau-bed had been unfolded
        and set in readiness at one of the walls, while a blazing fire burned in
        the grate, although the day was anything but cold. Before I had time to
        speculate upon the meaning of all these mysterious preparations, I heard
        Burnham calling, so throwing my coat on a settee I hastened to join him.
        I found him engaged in firing up a small portable steam-engine that
        stood in one corner of the yard, and in affixing to the exhaust-pipe of
        the cylinder another pipe, several feet in length, with a movable arm,
        evidently for the purpose of ejecting steam in any desired direction.
      </p>
      <p>“Now,” he said, as he completed the connection, “while the boiler is
        getting up steam, you and I must get to work and uncover our package. I
        expected Dr. Dunne here before this, but doctors, you know, are always
        entitled to latitude in non-professional matters.” </p>
      <p>So saying, he took a knife and began to cut away the ropes from the
        package, I following his example. Then we removed layer after layer of
        sacking, the air growing, I thought, all the time sensibly colder, till
        upon removing the last of the sack-cloth&#8212;we could not, of course,
        remove the wrapping on which the weight rested, but merely contented
        ourselves with ripping the top open and letting it fall on either
        side&#8212;what was my surprise to see before me an immense oblong block
        of blue, pellucid ice. But who shall express my feelings when, a moment
        after, I discerned <i>imbedded in the heart of the transparent crystal
          the form of a man</i>.</p>
      <p>But let me describe what I saw. There, lying on its back in the middle
        of the frozen slab, was unmistakably the body of a man, but so
        wonderfully life-like in every detail that it was as difficult to
        believe that the man was dead as it was to conceive how he had come into
        his present position. The eyes were dark and wide open, and whether or
        not it was due to some peculiar refracting qualities of the medium
        through which they were observed, they did not look glassy or seem to
        have lost their lustre. The short, thick, curly black locks that
        clustered about the forehead, and the closely trimmed beard that fringed
        the cheeks, looked as natural as they could have done in the heyday of
        life. But just as inexplicable was the dress. It was composed of some
        light material such as is worn in hot climates, and had more in common
        with the ancient Greek chlamys, or the Arab burnous, than with any other
        type of dress that I recall. Such colors as it had were tasteful and
        resplendent, and had lost none of their original freshness. The feet
        were shod with sandals, and a gemmed ring still sparkled upon one of the
        fingers of the right hand. It was the face and figure of a handsome man
        of thirty, or thereabouts, and the whole posture was so indicative of
        repose as to indicate that, whoever he might be, he had met his end
        calmly and without pain.</p>
      <p>I turned mechanically toward Burnham and saw that he was watching my
        surprise and smiling.</p>
      <p>“Well, what do you think of my package,” he asked; “was it worth the
        trouble of bringing it here from the Arctic circle?”</p>
      <p>“I must congratulate you on your specimen,” I returned; “it will
        certainly be a great acquisition to our scientific men and antiquaries.
        But how are you going to preserve it? Won’t you find it rather a
        difficult matter to keep the ice in a state of congelation&#8212;and
        expensive, too, I should think?”</p>
      <p>“That is not my intention,” he replied; “I mean to thaw him out.” </p>
      <p>“And then?” I queried.</p>
      <p>“Resuscitate him.”</p>
      <p>I looked at my friend to see if he were not joking, but could detect no
        sign of mirth about his face.</p>
      <p>“Why not?” he said; “that man in the ice there is as organically
        perfect as you or I are. No fibre or atom of his organism has undergone
        any change since he came into the condition he is now in. Say that he
        met his death&#8212;if indeed he is dead&#8212;by drowning, and the
        water he was drowned in was subsequently frozen, he is no worse off at
        this moment, even though he has been lying where he is thousands of
        years, than the man who was drowned five minutes ago. And I hold, and my
        friend Dr. Dunne agrees with me&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>Dr. Dunne, one of the most scientific physicians and surgeons in the
        city, as is well known, entered the court-yard at that moment, after
        giving a secret knock, and apologized for his tardiness.</p>
      <p>“My friend, Dr. Dunne, I say, agrees with me, that our treatment of
        drowned, or so-called drowned, men is all wrong, and that they can be
        resuscitated hours after death has apparently supervened, if the proper
        measures are taken. Drowning is simply a case of arrested function, that
        is all. Provided the organism is sound, why should it not be made to
        perform its functions again? Does a temporary stoppage ruin a watch if
        the works are all right? If so, what are doctors and watch-makers for, I
        should like to know? Is it not so, doctor?”</p>
      <p>“At all events we can try,” rejoined the doctor, impressively; “I am
        heartily glad of such a favorable, such an ultra-favorable, opportunity,
        I should say, of testing the efficacy of my treatment of drowned men
        upon so promising a subject.” </p>
      <p>“But what about the freezing, doctor?” I ventured to remark, for the
        coolness with which the whole subject was treated reminded me painfully
        of my own deficiencies of scientific lore and rendered me
        proportionately modest. “I have always understood that frozen limbs are
        as good as dead, and that amputation alone can save the life of the rest
        of the organism in such a case. It seems to me that when the whole body
        is frozen, so much the worse.”</p>
      <p>“So much the better,” returned the doctor, warmly; “it is much easier
        to work where the conditions are homogeneous.”</p>
      <p>By this time the steam escaping from the safety-valve of the portable
        engine showed that the pressure was considerable, and Burnham, who had
        previously shifted the slide-valve so that the steam would pass straight
        into the exhaust, now wheeled the engine opposite the block of ice,
        pointed the lateral pipe, which he had connected with the exhaust, and
        which he manipulated on its joint by means of a fork, toward the side of
        the block, turned the globe-valve and let the jet of blue vapor play
        upon the ice. The court-yard was soon thick with clouds of steam, but
        the huge ice-block kept dwindling away as the steam was directed upon
        one point or the other, by wheeling the engine round it, till in less
        than half an hour the court-yard was little better than a puddle and
        nothing remained of the ice-block but a crystal envelope, a few inches
        thick, around the inclosed body, so deftly and skillfully had Burnham
        directed the steam-jet upon all portions alike. </p>
      <p>“We shall now have to exercise more care,” he remarked; “the remaining
        ice must be removed in a more gentle manner. Help me to carry the body
        into the laboratory.”</p>
      <p>So saying, we all lent a hand and transferred the ice-bound body to the
        zinc tray upon the trestles in the laboratory, in which a roaring
        stove-fire had previously been lit, and the temperature of which, when
        the doors were shut, was like that of a Turkish bath. </p>
      <p>“There!” ejaculated Burnham, who, though in his shirt-sleeves, was
        perspiring freely and panting after his work; “so far, so good. Let us
        go into the studio and sit down and rest while <i>our guest</i>”&#8212;I
        was struck with the quaintness of the epithet as applied to the corpse
        in the next room, as also with the emphasis Burnham gave it&#8212;“sheds
        the remnant of the crystal mantle he has worn for who shall say how many
        thousand years. It will take at least half an hour before he is
        completely thawed out, and meanwhile, if you like, I will tell you how I
        managed to run across him in the Far North.”</p>
      <p>We were all curious to know, so Burnham gave the following details:
      </p>
      <p>“After leaving San Francisco in March, last year, we sailed North with
        the intention of reaching Behring Sea by the time the ice broke up,
        hoping to do well enough with whales and seals to return before the
        season closed. I had, of course, made my arrangements with the captain,
        going as a volunteer, to do duty or not as I pleased, and living in the
        cabin. We had the usual adventures which are part and parcel of a
        whaler’s experience, and which I will not bother you with, as they are
        not germane to the question, and I found my health improving wonderfully
        under the influence of the fresh air, exercise, and excitement.</p>
      <p>“By June we had passed Behring Straits and then cruised for a good many
        weeks in the open sea beyond; but our luck was bad, and, owing to trying
        to better it before we left, we waited too long; worse than that, we
        were caught by a storm which blew us nearly due north for several days
        to a point some hundred miles east of Banks’s Land and the Parry Isles;
        and before we knew where we were, we found ourselves shut in by the ice,
        luckily in the lee of some bluffs, forming part of a small island only a
        few square miles in extent, to which circumstance alone we could
        attribute the escape of our vessel from being crushed by the ice-pack.
        Subsequent observations showed that we were in longitude 162 degrees W.
        and about latitude 76 degrees N.&#8212;a point, by the way, rarely
        reached by navigators even under the most exceptionally favorable
        circumstances. There was nothing for it, however, but to make the best
        of a bad job and prepare to winter it out with the best grace we could.
        Luckily we had plenty of provisions&#8212;I had looked after the matter
        of commissariat, personally, before embarking&#8212;and I think I may
        safely say that few whalers ever wintered in the Arctic circle better
        equipped in that respect than we were.</p>
      <p>“As you can readily imagine, the life of a ship’s crew, ice-bound,
        during the long, dark, northern winter is not an enviable one. Suffice
        it to say that we got through it with probably less than the ordinary
        amount of hardship, and were very glad to catch a glimpse of the sun
        about the beginning of April, as it looked like a sign of release,
        though the captain did not think the ice would break up for at least six
        weeks longer. There was now some pleasure in rambling, as there were a
        few hours of sunlight to do it by, and I used to make the most of it, as
        one might get an occasional pop at a seal or otter, and not unfrequently
        the captain&#8212;we were by this time great chums&#8212;would accompany
        me.</p>
      <p>“One day in May we were tramping along, gun in hand, over the
        ice-fields, going over some new ground to the east of the ship, when we
        came upon a patch of remarkably clear and transparent ice, about a mile
        from the vessel. This was the more peculiar as the generality of the ice
        in our neighborhood was rough, jagged, opaque, and usually coated with
        snow. Looking down casually as we were crossing this patch, my eye was
        arrested by the curious spectacle of the body of a man embedded in the
        ice, some sixteen or eighteen feet below the surface. I called the
        captain’s attention to the phenomenon, and, getting down on our hands
        and knees, we spent a good while in examining the strange object as well
        as we could, and speculating upon how it could have got there. What
        puzzled us most was the white clothing upon the body, the captain’s
        theory being that it was the corpse of some officer of consequence,
        belonging, perhaps, to some government expedition, whose shroud had
        burst its canvas casing after being consigned to the deep, and which had
        afterward drifted there with the currents and frozen fast. I, however,
        whose eyes were keener, could see that the dress upon the body was no
        shroud, and that the features, instead of being livid, bloated, and
        swollen, like those of a corpse that had been some time in the water,
        were clear-cut, fresh, and untouched by decay. I became anxious to
        obtain a nearer view of this strange discovery, and at length prevailed
        upon the captain to let me have the use of half a dozen of the crew to
        dig down through the ice till I could satisfy my curiosity regarding it.
        Accordingly, next morning we set to work with pick and shovel to sink a
        shaft in the ice, and it was only the work of an hour or two before we
        were within two feet of the body.</p>
      <p>“At this distance I renewed my examination and became the more and more
        impressed and mystified as I did so. But my astonishment was still
        further increased when, upon gazing downward through the pellucid depths
        below, I saw, or thought I saw, the dim outlines of buildings, just as
        they might seem from the top of some tall monument. I thought I could
        detect lines of streets and squares, the buildings on which were white
        as of marble, their architecture seeming to approach the Grecian in
        type. Gardens and trees, too, I thought I saw, but the light of the low
        sun was so feeble that I did not know whether it might not all be due to
        the fantastic forms of sea-weed, and that imagination was doing the
        rest. As it was, however, the impression I received served to increase
        my interest in the mysterious object beneath me.</p>
      <p>“I now resolved to secure possession of this wonderful windfall, from a
        scientific standpoint, which luck had thrown in my way; and by dint of
        promising a liberal reward to my assistants I succeeded in persuading
        them to dig round and below the body, leaving the block, which we just
        now melted, only supported securely enough at its ends to keep it from
        breaking down, till such time as we were prepared to remove it. Here,
        again, I had a bitter altercation with the captain, when I mooted my
        design of carrying off my prize. It was absurd, he said, preposterous,
        to think of packing a huge block of ice, containing only the dead body
        of a man, and of no earthly use to anybody. Did I think that whalers
        were fitted out for costly voyages into polar seas for the fun of the
        thing? Look at the room it would take, if nothing else. No; he must draw
        the line there; he would be d&#8212;&#8212;d if he gave his countenance
        to any such nonsense as that, science or no science.</p>
      <p>“I now saw that it was neck or nothing. There is nothing so obdurate as
        a sea-captain, if he sets his foot down, and by long association I knew
        my man. I determined to try him on a new tack, and to go to almost any
        length in doing so, partly through the spirit of opposition which is
        strong within me, and partly because I had already formulated, in a
        vague manner, the scheme which we are now carrying into practice. I felt
        a deep conviction, too, that I was in some mysterious way working out
        mysterious ends, and that gave new strength to my resolve.</p>
      <p>“‘Captain,’ I said that evening as we sat in the cabin, ‘what do you
        estimate that your present trip is worth?’</p>
      <p>“‘Worth nothing as yet,’ he answered, with a growl; ‘worse luck to it.’
      </p>
      <p>“‘I mean what would you take for the net earnings of the voyage,
        provided somebody bought your chances for what you might pick up upon
        the return?’ </p>
      <p>“The captain studied. It was plain that I had given his ideas a new
        turn. Perhaps he divined the bent of mine.</p>
      <p>“‘Well,’ he said, at length, ‘there would be the crew to be considered,
        as well as myself, in a case of that sort. We’re all working on shares.
        Captain gets half, and the other half of the net proceeds are divided
        <i>pro rata</i> among the petty officers and crew. What would suit me
        mightn’t suit them.’ </p>
      <p>“‘Well, what could you reasonably expect to take on the home voyage
        with average luck?’ I said, returning to the charge.</p>
      <p>“‘Half a dozen sperm-whales wouldn’t be out of the way,’ returned the
        captain, cheerily; ‘might get more. Catch might range anywhere from
        twenty to forty thousand dollars.’</p>
      <p>“‘Call it thirty thousand,’ I said; ‘would that be a fair average?’
      </p>
      <p>“‘Well, there’s twenty-two of a crew. That would net about seven
        hundred dollars apiece for their share. I don’t think they would growl
        at that. Fifteen thousand would suit me, and I think I should be very
        well out of it, for that matter. But why do you ask such questions?’</p>
      <p>“‘Read that,’ I said, for answer, and shoved a slip of paper across the
        table.</p>
      <p>“‘Why, what’s this?’ said the captain, taking up the slip of paper and
        reading:</p>

      <div style='text-align:right; margin-bottom:0.7em' class='sc'> Richard
        Burnham. </div>
      <p>“‘Simply a check for your possible gains on the return voyage, captain.
        I want the use of your ship as far as San Francisco. Everything
        satisfactory, I suppose. Good-night.’ So saying, I strolled into my
        stateroom, leaving the worthy captain to deliberate upon my proposal.
      </p>
      <p>“Next morning I purposely got up late; but by the earnest and
        many-voiced conversation which I could faintly hear, upon the deck above
        me, I knew that the seed I had sown was germinating, if not bearing
        fruit.</p>
      <p>“Well, to cut a long story short, my proposal was accepted; the
        ice-block dug out and conveyed to the vessel with a good deal of
        trouble; my check certified and cashed in Victoria, where most of the
        crew were paid off, and&#8212;&#8212;here we are. Now, suppose we
        adjourn to the laboratory and see if <i>our guest</i> has completely
        thawed out yet.” </p>
      <p>The strong heat from the stove had, in truth, very nearly finished what
        the steam had begun. Though there was still a shell of ice surrounding
        the body, it was little more than a shell, and Dr. Dunne recommended
        that the next stage in the treatment should be approached with all
        expedition. Burnham, accordingly, went off to prepare a bath in the
        bath-room adjoining the studio, and when he hailed us, the doctor and
        myself carried in the zinc tray with the body and deposited the latter
        in the bath.</p>
      <p>“We must proceed very slowly,” said the doctor, as he stood by,
        thermometer in hand; “I shall begin with a temperature of fifty and
        increase it very gradually&#8212;say, in half an hour or so&#8212;to
        blood heat. All the internal organs are, of course, frozen; the lungs,
        too, are doubtless full of ice, and the first thing to be done is to
        relieve them of the water. Not the least remarkable feature, gentlemen,”
        he continued, turning to us, “is that this body must have been frozen
        almost before&#8212;in my theory, certainly before&#8212;it was drowned.
        But how to account for this? That is the point. It is certainly beyond
        the range of our scientific experience, nor can we conceive of any
        natural or chemical force powerful enough to effect such a result. This
        man, too, is clad in the garb of a tropical, or sub-tropical, region.
        These are evidently his every-day clothes which he is wearing. He must
        have been both drowned and frozen almost simultaneously. The drowning
        and the freezing must have been nearly coincident events&#8212;at all
        events, within an hour or two of each other. I can not see into it. I
        give it up,” concluded the doctor, with a shake of the head. </p>
      <p>“Still,” said Burnham, “have we not something of a parallel in the
        elephants which, some years ago, were found embedded in the ice to the
        north of Siberia, just as this man was? The elephant is a tropical
        animal, and can scarcely be credited with going to the North Pole on a
        pleasure trip. How do you account for that?”</p>
      <p>“Perhaps,” suggested I, “it was a case of the mountain coming to
        Mahomet in both instances. Perhaps the pole came to them. Suppose that
        through some unknown natural cause, or some outside cosmical agency, the
        axis of the earth should change abruptly, as it is probable that it is
        now doing gradually, and that what were formerly the equatorial regions
        became the polar, and <i>vice versâ</i>, what would naturally follow? In
        the first place, the oceans and seas would be hurled over the continents
        in tidal waves miles high. Only mountaineers dwelling in the highest
        altitudes would escape. That would be the first result. The second would
        be that the waters upon what were formerly the tropical regions would be
        frozen. The third would be&#8212;&#8212;what we see before us now in
        that bath.” </p>
      <p>“Very ingenious, certainly,” remarked the doctor, dryly; “but we have
        got no time for speculation now. Let us attend to business. Our friend
        here should be pretty thoroughly warmed through by this time. Please
        lend a hand to get him on the operating-table.”</p>
      <p>Accordingly, we removed the body from the bath to the mattress in the
        studio, the room having been meanwhile closed and its temperature raised
        to blood heat.</p>
      <p>“We must first get the water out of the lungs,” said the doctor, as he
        reached for what looked something like a stomach-pump, but which,
        instead of the suction tube, terminated in a diaphragm made of some
        elastic substance, which he applied to the open mouth of the body,
        pressing it closely with his left hand, at the same time asking me to
        compress the nostrils tightly. The flesh was now warm, soft, and
        yielding. The doctor then drew back the piston of his pump and a stream
        of water followed through the discharge tube. This was repeated several
        times, till the lungs were pronounced free from water. </p>
      <p>A consultation now followed between the doctor and Burnham.</p>
      <p>“The blood in the veins and arteries,” said the doctor, “though it has
        undergone liquefaction, is probably, to a certain extent, coagulated.
        Though why,” he continued, musingly, “should such be the case? At any
        rate, let us see.”</p>
      <p>He then took a lancet from his instrument-case and proceeded to make an
        incision in the median vein of the left arm, when, to his manifest joy,
        as I could see, a few drops of blood spurted out.</p>
      <p>“Yes! it is as I thought,” he exclaimed, joyfully; “the blood has
        <i>not</i> coagulated. It is a simple case of drowning, and, to all
        intents and purposes, our friend here is no better and no worse off than
        if he had been asphyxiated by water only a few hours ago. Mr. Burnham, I
        congratulate you,” taking that gentleman by the hand and shaking it with
        the utmost enthusiasm, “upon being instrumental in providing a subject
        for resuscitation&#8212;for resuscitate him I do not doubt that I shall,
        now that I have direct evidence that the blood has undergone no chemical
        change&#8212;a subject, compared with which a mere, ordinary case of
        drowning sinks into the most infinitesimal insignificance; for&#8212;who
        can tell?&#8212;perhaps this man has lain in this condition for
        hundreds, aye, for thousands of years; perhaps he belongs to a remote
        prehistoric age, for ice, the great embalmer, knows neither time nor
        seasons, and a thousand years are to it but as one hour. Whatever our
        friend here is, or has been, he will presently be one of us; he will
        open his mouth and unlock the secrets of the past. He will tell us how
        he came to be in his present plight. He will add another page to the
        world’s history.”</p>
      <p>I felt myself catching all the doctor’s enthusiasm, and now hung upon
        everything that he did with breathless interest.</p>
      <p>“The next step,” said the doctor, “is to stimulate the heart’s action
        and restore the circulation. To do this will require our united efforts.
        You, Mr. Burnham, will take charge of the battery and apply the
        electrodes; our friend here”&#8212;signifying myself&#8212;“will assist
        in inflating the lungs; I will attend to the circulation. Your battery
        is ready, is it not, Mr. Burnham?”</p>
      <p>The battery, with its auxiliary apparatus for intensifying the current,
        was brought round and placed on a table close by. Dr. Dunne then made an
        incision in the breast so as to expose the breast-bone, or sternum, and
        another in the back, in the region of the third vertebra. To the former
        of these the negative pole of the battery was applied, and to the latter
        the positive electrode.</p>
      <p>“Where is that phial, I wonder?” interjected the doctor, looking over
        his medicine-chest, and taking out bottle after bottle; “ah, here it
        is,” he said, at last, “here is the substance on which I rely to restore
        the action of the heart and give new life to our friend here. It has
        only lately been introduced into the pharmacopœia; but since its
        introduction it has done wonders in cardiac affections. It is distilled
        from a plant which grows only in East Africa. Its name is
        <i>strephanthus</i>, and its effect is to accelerate the action of the
        heart. It is now my purpose to inject a portion of this powerful
        stimulant into the median vein, which I have just opened, in our
        friend’s arm, whence it will be conveyed to the heart. Meanwhile, you,
        Mr. Burnham, and our friend here will induce artificial respiration in
        the lungs, so that the blood may be oxygenated after it has been
        expelled from the heart by the spasmodic valvular action which the
        <i>strephanthus</i> will excite in that organ. Now, let us each attend
        closely to his allotted duty.”</p>
      <p>My part consisted in inflating the lungs by means of a tiny bellows,
        the nozzle of which had been introduced into the larynx, till such time
        as the breathing should become automatic and the rise and fall of the
        lungs regular. At a given signal from the doctor, Burnham turned on the
        current, the electrodes having been previously placed in position, and,
        at the same instant, the chest expanded. I plied my bellows as the
        breast rose, and a second afterward it collapsed, the discharged air
        rushing back through the larynx with a whistling sound. Three seconds
        afterward the chest rose automatically again, and again I assisted its
        rise by inflating the lungs as before. This was kept up for some dozen
        or more respirations, occupying in all about two minutes.</p>
      <p>Meantime, the doctor was intently engaged with a syringe and graduating
        glass at the left arm of the body. So absorbed was he in his occupation
        that he seemed oblivious to everything else. Suddenly he sprang to his
        feet, with an exclamation which startled us.</p>
      <p>“We have won!” he shouted; “see! the blood is circulating.”</p>
      <p>I looked down at the arm, and, sure enough, blood was spurting in a
        thin jet from the lower extremity of the vein which the doctor had
        severed. In my excitement I had withdrawn the bellows from the mouth,
        but there was no further use for artificial respiration, as the chest
        was now rising and falling automatically and in regular cadence. The
        doctor now tied up the severed vein, sewed up the incision in the arm,
        and, after dressing the patient&#8212;for such he must now be
        called&#8212;in a suit of Burnham’s underwear, we lifted him into the
        bureau-bed that had been prepared at the side of the studio next the
        fire.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing more to be done,” said the doctor, simply; “he will
        wake by and by of his own accord, and will then need some nourishment.
        Soup and stimulants will be the proper thing to administer at first.”
      </p>
      <p>Burnham went out and returned presently with a tray containing the
        desired refreshments. We now waited anxiously for the awakening, which
        must sooner or later come. The breathing, which had hitherto been
        labored and stertorous, was becoming easier, the color was returning to
        the cheeks, and the occasional twitching of the muscles showed that our
        strange patient was on the point of awaking. At length he turned on his
        side, opened his eyes, stared fixedly at us, and then uttered an
        exclamation in some foreign tongue. Burnham got up, wheeled a table to
        the side of the bed, set the tray of refreshments upon it, and motioned
        him to help himself, at the same time pouring out a glass of wine. Here
        Dr. Dunne interposed. </p>
      <p>“No,” he said, smiling; “after a fast of so many thousand years I
        certainly must prescribe hot water as an initiative. It is absolutely
        necessary for the stomach to begin with.”</p>
      <p>The hot water was brought, and our patient, evidently comprehending
        that he was under medical treatment, shifted his position in bed so as
        to recline upon his elbow, took the tumbler which was handed him, and,
        after eying it critically, raised it to his lips and tasted the
        contents. A shade of surprise and faint protest passed across his
        features as he elevated his eyebrows, shrugged his shoulders, and
        swallowed the potion.</p>
      <p>“Now let him attack the viands if he wants to,” said the doctor, as our
        guest’s eye roved somewhat greedily, I thought, over the table. Burnham
        pushed the tray a little nearer, no second invitation being necessary,
        and the bowl of soup that had been brought, together with a couple of
        glasses of old Madeira, speedily disappeared. This duty having been
        performed, our guest became voluble. He gesticulated and spoke, and, to
        judge by the inflexions of his voice and the character of his gestures,
        he was, I should say, appealing to us for an explanation of his presence
        there and of the strange objects which met his gaze. It need scarcely be
        said that we could not understand one word of what he was saying, though
        the voice was clear and mellow and the syllables of his words as
        distinct and sonorous as ancient Greek, though they bore no other
        resemblance to that language.</p>
      <p>“Suppose we bring him pen and ink and see if he can write,” suggested
        Burnham, and the idea struck us as a peculiarly happy one. </p>
      <p>Pen, ink, and paper were accordingly set upon the table. Our patient
        eyed the articles curiously for a moment or two, took up the pen, and
        examined the steel nib with an expression of critical approval, then
        took up a sheet of paper, examined its texture, and smiled, at the same
        time spreading it out before him. It was evident that he comprehended
        what was required of him, for he dipped the pen into the ink and wrote a
        few words upon the paper, guiding the pen, however, from right to left,
        according to Oriental usage. The characters partook more of the
        Chaldaic, or ancient Sanscrit, than any other type. As it was, none of
        us could make them out. Our guest watched our efforts at deciphering
        with an amused smile, but when one of our daily papers was handed him by
        Burnham, this quickly changed to an expression of rapt attention and
        intense interest. He did not, however, handle the sheet like a savage,
        but like one who knew the object of it, examining the words and letters
        with the closest attention, evidently to see whether he could gain any
        clew to their meaning. After a minute or two he gave up the task, and
        then, tapping his forehead with a tired expression, smiled at us, lay
        back on his pillow, and was soon fast asleep.</p>
      <p>“He will be all right by evening,” remarked the doctor; “and then,”
        turning to Burnham, “what will you do with him? Introduce him to the
        Academy of Sciences, I suppose?”</p>
      <p>“Not just yet,” returned Burnham; “I have no objection to some inkling
        of our wonderful prize getting out&#8212;our friend here,” alluding to
        me, “will, no doubt, attend to that&#8212;but I certainly shall not
        bring him before the public in any way, nor even introduce him to our
        scientific men, till I have educated him to some little knowledge of our
        language. There will, I think, be no difficulty about that. He is
        evidently a man of superior intelligence, and I shall go right to work
        in the same way as if he was any ordinary foreigner cast upon our shores
        with no knowledge of our language and I myself equally ignorant of his.
        It is merely giving names of objects, he learning my name for the
        object, I his. In that manner we shall speedily arrive at a solution of
        the all-absorbing question who this remarkable being is whom we have
        rescued from the jaws of death, and who, to all intents and purposes,
        has been dead for&#8212;who can tell?&#8212;how many ages past.”</p>
      <p>The events I have here detailed occurred on the ninth of August last.
        Since that time, my friend Burnham has been enthusiastically engaged in
        carrying out the project which he mapped out on the day of the
        resuscitation of his remarkable patient and guest. His tailor was called
        in, and, when Mr. Kourban Balanok, as the stranger calls himself, left
        Burnham’s studio three days after, he did so as a nineteenth-century
        gentleman, and is now installed in Burnham’s house as one of the family.
        People may have noticed the young, handsome, and distinguished stranger
        to be seen occasionally walking arm-in-arm with Burnham on Kearny or
        Market Street, but none would guess that he had lain in the North Polar
        ice in the neighborhood of ten thousand years. Such is the case,
        however, and, as he is fast acquiring an intimate knowledge of the
        English language, we may confidently look forward to the appearance, in
        the near future, of a detailed account of the economy of the prehistoric
        world, and of the vast cataclysm which swamped it and left Mr. Kourban
        Balanok embedded in the ice.</p>

        title='Leaves on the River Pasig'>LEAVES ON THE RIVER PASIG</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By W. O. McGeehan</div>
      <p>The Boulong <i>casco</i> lay on the Quiapo Market, which is on the left
        bank of the Pasig, just below the suspension-bridge. The Chinese
        junk&#8212;tradition says&#8212;was modeled after a whimsical emperor’s
        shoe, consequently the <i>cascos</i> of the Philippines, being really
        junks without sails, are not very dainty bits of naval architecture. As
        a rule, they are not accorded the dignity of a name; but this one was
        known as the “Boulong casco,” because it was owned and manned by members
        of one family. Santiago Boulong was steersman, his three sons were
        polemen, and Simplicia, the daughter, was <i>el capitan</i>&#8212;her
        father said, affectionately. Their permanent home was a little
        <i>nipa</i>-thatch shelter at the stern of the vessel.</p>
      <p>The men had gone ashore shortly after the mooring&#8212;the father on
        business, the sons on pleasure bent&#8212;and Simplicia, much to her
        disgust, was left on board. She was a Tagalo girl, of the
        light-complexioned type, pretty even when judged by our standards, of
        which fact she was aware. </p>
      <p>“The river, the river,” she said to herself, petulantly, “always the
        river. I was born on the river, and I have been going up and down the
        river all my life. When we come to Manila I may go ashore for a few
        hours only, and then the river again&#8212;and the lake. And Ramon is a
        fool!”</p>
      <p>It was a clear, warm night, and the rippling water of the Pasig
        glistened in the moonlight, so that she could see the leaves rush by in
        clusters. Ramon had said: “Think of me when you see the leaves on the
        river&#8212;the bright green leaves from the dear lake country. It seems
        sad to think that they must float down past the city where the water is
        fouled, and then out&#8212;far out&#8212;to be lost on the big salt
        sea.” But Ramon was always saying queer things that she could not
        understand. </p>
      <p>The murmur of drowsy voices came from the crowded huts of the
        market-place. Oh, how long till morning! She wanted to buy some bits of
        finery there, and then to stroll through the city, especially along the
        Escolta, where there were stores that exhibited splendors from all
        countries. She hoped that one of her brothers would hire a
        <i>carametta</i> the next evening, and take her to the Lunetta, where
        the wealthy of Manila congregated to enjoy the cool night air and the
        concert. A band of Americanos played there every evening. </p>
      <p>They were wonderful men, these Americano soldiers, much taller than
        Filipinos or Spaniards, and many of them had blue eyes and hair of the
        color of gold. The pride of kings was in their stride, and they looked
        as though they feared nothing. </p>
      <p>Farther on down the river at the Alhambra Café, where the Spanish
        officers once gathered to hear the music of Spain, the orchestra played
        a new air that delighted her. There was a burst of cheering. The music
        was “Dixie,” and the demonstration was made by some Tennessee
        volunteers, who always gave something reminiscent of the old “rebel
        yell” whenever they heard it. From the Cuartel Infanteria, across the
        river, the American bugles began to shrill a “tattoo.” Their music was
        wonderful&#8212;everything pertaining to these big, bold men was
        wonderful, she thought.</p>
      <p>Something bumped against a side of the <i>casco</i>, and Simplicia
        hurried over to order away a supposed ladrone. She leaned over the side
        with such abruptness that the wooden comb slipped from her heavy mass of
        black hair. It fell a dusky curtain, and brushed the upturned face of a
        man. He was not a little brown Filipino, but a tall Americano, fair and
        yellow-haired. He laughed a soft, pleasant laugh. She drew herself
        backward with a frightened cry, but his eyes held hers. The man was
        standing in a small canoe, steadying his craft by holding on to the
        <i>casco</i>.</p>
      <p>“<i>Buenas noches</i>,” he said, smiling. He spoke Spanish, but not
        like a Spaniard or a Tagalo. Simplicia smiled, faintly. She knew that
        she should go into the <i>nipa</i> cabin, but this handsome man looked
        so kind and&#8212;Ramon was a fool. And her father and brothers were
        selfish, and&#8212;&#8212; </p>
      <p>So Simplicia returned the salutation, and stood leaning over the
        bulwark tasting the delirious delight of her first flirtation. The
        man&#8212;he was a college boy until the United States Government gave
        him a suit of khaki and the right to bear the former
        designation&#8212;thrilled with joy at the delicious novelty of the
        situation. He was in a city that was at once the tropics and the Orient,
        and over which hung the glamour of departed mediæval days. For several
        hundred years guitars had tinkled on that river, and voices had been
        lifted to laticed windows. The air was laden with ghosts of everything
        but common sense and scruples.</p>
      <p>A bugle across the river caused the man to recollect that he was under
        certain restraint. “I must go,” he said, but he did not release his hold
        on the <i>casco</i>.</p>
      <p>Simplicia’s eyes were big and bright in the moonlight. He stretched out
        one arm and drew her face toward him. She tore herself away, and stood
        breathing hurriedly through parted lips.</p>
      <p>“<i>Mañana por la noche</i>,” said the soldier. He plied the paddle
        vigorously, and the canoe glided away. But he looked back, longingly,
        for Simplicia’s lips were very soft and warm.</p>
      <p>She stood gazing after him till the canoe vanished into the shadow of
        the Cuartel Infanteria. The unseen bugle softly wailed “taps,” the call
        that bids the soldier rest. It is also sounded over graves. </p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>The sun beat down fiercely on the Pasig. Canoes toiled up and skimmed
        down the river. Lumbering <i>cascos</i>, their crews naked to their
        waists, were poled painfully along. The Quiapo Market was astir with a
        babble of tongues, the barking of dogs, and the incessant challenge of
        hundreds of game-cocks. The little brown people bought, sold, and
        bargained with the full strength of their lungs. </p>
      <p>Simplicia, as purser of the <i>casco</i>, was in the market purchasing
        provisions, but she spent most of her time near the stall of a Chinese
        vender of fabrics. After much haggling, she became the possessor of a
        dainty bodice of silk and piña cloth.</p>
      <p>Most of the girls who visited the market-place seemed to be drawn to
        that spot, for there Simplicia met a friend who had left the lake
        country a little later than herself.</p>
      <p>“Ramon will come down the river to-night,” said the friend,
        breathlessly, delighted to carry a message of that sort. “He has written
        something that he thinks they may print in <i>La Libertad</i>. Isn’t
        that wonderful? You must feel so proud of him. For a man to be able to
        write at all is wonderful&#8212;but for the papers!”</p>
      <p>Apparently there were no words in the Tagalo dialect strong enough to
        express the girl’s admiration. Simplicia tossed her head, loosening the
        hair, a frequent happening. She caught the heavy tresses quickly, and
        almost forgot for an instant everything but the last time they had
        fallen.</p>
      <p>“Are you not pleased?” asked the other girl, in astonishment. She was
        dark, and not pretty from any point of view.</p>
      <p>“Oh, yes,” drawled Simplicia, “but Ramon is very tedious sometimes, and
        the lake country is very dreary. We will go into the city this afternoon
        and see the Americanos.”</p>
      <p>They saw many Americanos&#8212;State volunteers clad in blue shirts and
        khaki trousers. The city was full of them. They occupied all the
        barracks formerly the quarters of the Spanish soldiers, and they crowded
        the drinking-resorts. Along the Calle Real they came upon companies
        drilling, and on the Lunetta they saw an entire regiment on
        dress-parade.</p>
      <p>Simplicia, though she scanned every soldier’s face, did not see the
        stranger of the previous night, nor did she see a face that seemed
        nearly as handsome.</p>
      <p>“They say,” mused the other girl, “that the men of Aguinaldo will drive
        these Americanos out of Manila if they do not go of their own accord
        soon.” </p>
      <p>Simplicia laughed scornfully, and pointed toward the troops. The men
        were in battalion front, standing at “present,” and the sun glistened on
        a thousand bayonets.</p>
      <p>“But there are only a few Americanos and there are many thousands of
        Filipinos,” said the girl.</p>
      <p>“The Americanos will take what they want and nothing can stop them,”
        announced Simplicia, decisively. “Let us go to our <i>cascos</i>.”</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>The twilight gathered on the river. In the north the sky was lit by
        continuous flashes of lightning. Myriads of stars were overhead, and the
        Southern Cross was viceroy of the heavens, for the moon had not yet come
        into her kingdom. The water noisily gurgled by, and Simplicia waited.
        Which would come first, the tedious Filipino school-master lover or the
        stranger? Would the Americano come again? </p>
      <p>She watched every canoe that passed, but they were all going up or
        down. The moon appeared and clearly revealed the river’s surface.
        Simplicia fixed her eyes on the shadow of the Cuartel Infanteria.
        Something emerged from it and glided rapidly through the stream. It was
        a canoe, and it was being paddled with strong, sure strokes toward her.
        Her heart beat tumultuously, and she almost cried out in her delight.
      </p>
      <p>He came, and, fastening his canoe, swung himself aboard the
        <i>casco</i>. Her arms were about his neck in an instant, and her
        beautiful tresses escaped the comb again.</p>
      <p>They sat in the shade of the <i>nipa</i> thatch talking in low tones.
        His arm was round her waist. Her head rested on his shoulder. He puffed
        with deep breaths of enjoyment a cigarette that she had daintily lit for
        him. The intoxication of the country was in his brain&#8212;the devil
        that whispers, “There is nothing but pleasure, and no time but now.”</p>
      <p>The <i>plunk-plunk</i> of a guitar close by startled them both.
        Simplicia trembled violently.</p>
      <p>“It is a foolish man who is always singing to me,” she explained. </p>
      <p>A clear, musical voice rose in a song, and the soldier checked a
        question to listen, for the voice and the song charmed him from the
        first note. The song was in Spanish, and, though he was by no means
        perfect in the language, he caught the meaning and spirit of it. It ran
        something to this effect:</p>
      <div class='poetry-container'>
        <div class='poetry'>
          <div class='stanza'>
            <div class='verse'>Bright are the leaves and the blossoms that grow
              in the beautiful lake country,</div>
            <div class='verse'>They fill the place with brilliance of things
              celestial.</div>
            <div class='verse'>Some of them drop or are thrown to the river,
            </div>
            <div class='verse'>Helpless they drift on its swift running surface.
            </div>
            <div class='verse'>Down past the city through sliminess foul, </div>
            <div class='verse'>Out they are whirled to waters eternal</div>
            <div class='verse'>Lost and forgotten forever and ever.</div>
            <div class='verse'>Blossom I cherish; I’ll hold thee.</div>
            <div class='verse'>Never shalt thou leave the lake country. </div>
            <div class='verse'>But my heart, it is sad for the leaves on the
              Pasig. </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The last words died on the air like the sob or the faint cry of a
        passing spirit. The soldier sat mute, like one bewitched by fairy music.
        Simplicia’s lips, pressed against his cheek, brought him back to her.
      </p>
      <p>“I do not care for him. On my soul, I do not!” she whispered. She was
        pretty, and her arm tightened coaxingly about his neck. His better
        nature was conquered, and the devil in his blood reigned supreme. The
        situation suddenly seemed highly amusing, and he laughed a suppressed
        laugh of recklessness. To be serenaded by a native poet while the arm of
        the troubadour’s lady-love encircled his neck&#8212;verily he would have
        a great tale to tell some day. </p>
      <p>There was a faint sound of a footfall on the deck of the <i>casco</i>.
        The soldier disengaged himself. A face peeped in through an opening in
        the thatch, and the American struck it a sharp blow with his fist. He
        would have rushed after the intruder, but Simplicia held him.</p>
      <p>“It is only a foolish man,” she said, “do not follow him. It would make
        trouble.”</p>
      <p>“I would not bring you any trouble,” he said. “What is the matter? You
        tremble.”</p>
      <p>“It is nothing,” she replied. “I love you.”</p>
      <p>The soldier’s conscience smote him. He swore that he loved her, and
        tried to believe that it was true. She seemed almost happy again. </p>
      <p>“To-morrow the <i>casco</i> goes up to the lake again, and we will be
        gone three days. Oh, that is so long!”</p>
      <p>“Very long,” he assented.</p>
      <p>“But you will wait and think of me always.”</p>
      <p>“Yes, I will watch the leaves on the river&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>She shuddered.</p>
      <p>“No! no! Do not speak of them. <i>Madre de Dios!</i> I hate the river,
        and I hate the leaves it drags along. I think I hate everything but
        you.”</p>
      <p>The soldier was young, and this was his first experience with hysteria
        and woman, which combination often disturbs even wiser heads. It
        disturbed him exceedingly, but he soothed her finally with the wildest
        vows and many kisses. He kissed a tress of her long hair as he stepped
        from the <i>casco’s</i> poling platform into his canoe.</p>
      <p>For the second time she watched the canoe till it glided into the
        shadows. Then she shivered violently, chilled to the bone.</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>A sergeant of a certain regiment of United States volunteers was
        prowling along the brink of the Pasig, outside the Cuartel Infanteria’s
        walls, looking for a pet monkey that had disappeared. Something in the
        long grass caught his eye, and he stopped. He stepped back quickly and
        hurried around the corner of the wall, returning with four soldiers.</p>
      <p>He parted the grass with his arms, and they saw the dead body of a
        Filipino girl. Her face was concealed by a disordered mass of black
        hair, and, pinned to her breast by a rudely fashioned knife that was
        buried to the hilt, was a miniature insurgent flag.</p>
      <p>They tenderly bore the body to the pathway, and the hair fell from the
        face. One of the soldiers let go his hold and tottered to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>“Harrison’s a softy,” grunted one of the men. “Take hold, sergeant.
        He’s fainted, I guess.”</p>
      <p>The form was placed in an unused storeroom. When the news went round
        the men came to view it, not out of curiosity, but to show respect such
        as they would pay to their own dead.</p>
      <p>“This is the way I make it out,” said the sergeant, sagely. “The girl
        was killed by Aguinaldo’s gang, and it must have been because she spoke
        a good word for our people.”</p>
      <p>“And we’ll take it out of their hides when the time comes,” said one of
        the soldiers, snapping his jaws together, which resolution the regiment
        unanimously adopted. Even the chaplain refrained from chiding when he
        heard of it. He knew his flock.</p>
      <p>There being no way of finding out anything about the girl, a fund was
        quickly collected and arrangements made for the funeral. Several hundred
        soldiers followed the hearse to the cemetery at El Paco.</p>
      <p>The regimental chaplain read the regulation burial service, while the
        men stood with bared heads. They placed at the head of the freshly made
        mound a plain board that read:</p>
      <div class='tac'>FOUND IN THE PASIG.</div>
      <p>After the last soldier had gone, a cowering thing walked unsteadily up
        to the grave, and, kneeling beside it, laid down a cluster of green
        leaves.</p>
      <p>“By God! I did love her. I did,” he muttered, continuously. He drew a
        pencil from his pocket and scratched her name on the board: “Simplicia.”
      </p>
      <p>And his youth was buried there.</p>

      <p>To Euchretown, Los Angeles County, came Mr. Stoker and his wife. He
        bought ranches, and, strikingly dressed, drove about in the rubber-tired
        buggies of real-estate agents; while Mrs. Stoker, a handsome young
        woman, sniffed the social air. Just what should she do to win, with
        <i>éclat</i>, the commanding place in the local feminine view? For her
        no slow progress to social supremacy! Rather the Napoleonic sweeping
        away of rivals.</p>
      <p>At that stage of its rise from a desert to a paradise Euchretown was
        belied by its name. A sombreness hovered over the thought of the place;
        the method of life was Puritanic. Euchre? One would have thought there
        was never a deck in the town. </p>
      <p>“I don’t want to be un-Christian,” snapped the wife of Reverend Hummel;
        “but I wish that Mrs. Stoker had never stuck her foot in this town.”</p>
      <p>Mrs. Hummel was out of place linked to a preacher. Fairly well had she
        clothed her mind in the prevalent Puritanic mood; but in her heart she
        was different. As for social leaders, she was the one, and she knew it.
      </p>
      <p>“Why, Jennie,” complained the Reverend Hummel, a pale gentleman with
        eyes that ever bespoke a receptive surprise at his debts; “your words
        ring evil. And then the term you employed&#8212;stuck. How, pray, could
        Mrs. Stoker stick her foot?”</p>
      <p>At this moment the maid (employed despite the mortgaged condition of
        Hummel’s real estate) ushered in Mrs. Banker Wheelock.</p>
      <p>“And <i>have</i> you heard the news about Mrs. Stoker!” cried Mrs.
        Wheelock, as Mr. Hummel, wandering away, hummed “Throw Out the Life
        Line” in a fumbling voice. “Oh, haven’t you got an invitation?”</p>
      <p>“What is it?” said Mrs. Hummel, darkly.</p>
      <p>“A euchre-party! Everybody!”</p>
      <p>Mrs. Hummel’s arms dropped limp.</p>
      <p>“But, of course,” she said, “nobody will go.”</p>
      <p>“They’re all wild about it!” ejaculated Mrs. Wheelock; “Mrs. Stoker is
        said to have struck the psychological moment.”</p>
      <p>Mrs. Hummel started up.</p>
      <p>“There hasn’t been a card-party for years!” cried she; “where’ll she
        get her decks? Does she carry around a trunk full? Or will she clean out
        the saloons? But&#8212;&#8212;” and the tears leaped up to her lashes,
        “I wouldn’t be un-Christian about it.” </p>
      <p>Mrs. Wheelock arose and laid her hands on Mrs. Hummel’s arm.</p>
      <p>“Of course, dear, you know the only reason you wouldn’t be invited is
        that you’re the preacher’s wife,” soothed she; and then, with a puzzled
        air: “That <i>must</i> be the reason.”</p>
      <p>Now the maid brought in an envelope. It was Mr. and Mrs. Hummel’s
        invitation to Mrs. Stoker’s euchre-party. The eye of Jennie met that of
        Mrs. Wheelock, as a partial relief made its way into the breast of the
        preacher’s wife.</p>
      <p>“Did you ever hear of such impudence?” she breathed.</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>Mrs. Stoker had a new green cottage with nine Corinthian pillars
        (capitals enormously ornate) along her front porch. Within, electric
        lights, white-pine woodwork, brilliant floral tributes of Axminster
        carpets, and bird’s-eye maple furniture combined to produce an effect
        luxurious, irrefutable.</p>
      <p>“Oh, yes,” natty Stoker was saying to the men, “I gave him three
        thousand for his ten acres. Wheelock, run over to the city with me
        to-morrow and look at the Pasadena Villa Tract. I’ve a mind to pick up a
        bunch of those lots.” </p>
      <p>“O <i>Mrs.</i> Hummel!” came Mrs. Stoker’s winning voice, and everybody
        listened. There was the purple-draped hostess flowing toward the
        preacher’s wife. “I was dreadfully afraid you wouldn’t come! I’m
        <i>so</i>” (powerful kiss) “glad you did! And dear Mr. Hummel?”</p>
      <p>“To-night he works on his sermon,” said Mrs. Hummel, beaming about on
        the faces of the alert and delightfully surprised company. “I persuaded
        him to run in for me later; for I just came to look on. Of course,” here
        she turned the sweet lips toward Mrs. Stoker, “you couldn’t expect us to
        play.”</p>
      <p>Mrs. Stoker put new fuel in her smile to Mrs. Hummel; and Mrs. Hummel
        did likewise further fire up her smile to Mrs. Stoker; and the edified
        company sat down.</p>
      <p>The games went on with a vim that made it seem some hungry gambling
        spirit, dormant in the town, rose up and reveled. Mrs. Stoker had risked
        it all on her belief in the psychological moment&#8212;and won! The town
        was ready for sin.</p>
      <p>“And that little statue is the prize,” now said Mrs. Stoker, moving
        about. “Mrs. Hummel, would you hold it up?”</p>
      <p>All eyes came round in sneaking way toward Mrs. Hummel, who grew
        pallid. There, on the mantel, near her hand as she stood to watch, was
        the statuette&#8212;a nude Greek maid.</p>
      <p>“Would you mind holding it up? They can’t see,” repeated Mrs. Stoker,
        louder, fires in her eyes.</p>
      <p>Hypnotized, Mrs. Hummel lifted it and saw a price tag, $7.50.</p>
      <p>“Why,” said she, forcing into her voice the daring experiment of a note
        of censure, “I didn’t know there was to be a prize!”</p>
      <p>“Oh,” echoed Mrs. Wheelock from a distance, instilling into her tones a
        strain of triumph, “I didn’t know there was to be a prize!” </p>
      <p>“No!” chimed all the women, in mutually sanctioning delight, “we didn’t
        know there was to be a prize!”</p>
      <p>“Just a cheap little thing,” said Mrs. Stoker.</p>
      <p>A new brightening of eyes fastened on euchre decks. The games went on
        with strange excitement; for, lo! all the women had suddenly resolved to
        win or ruin their nerves in the fight.</p>
      <p>“Would you punch&#8212;while I look to the sherbet?” whispered Mrs.
        Stoker to Mrs. Hummel, with new, bald patronage.</p>
      <p>The preacher’s wife stared round. The fascination of the game was
        influencing her. She felt her footing go; she saw the Stoker triumph,
        the reins gone from her hand. Desperately did she leap at this only
        chance to cling to the victorious vehicle of pleasure which her rival
        from this night on was to drive headlong through the Puritanic mood of
        Euchretown.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Hummel punched the cards.</p>
      <p>More fierce became the spirit of gaming, until, with final shriek of
        delight, Mrs. Wheelock won the statue. Followed by jealous eyes she took
        it. </p>
      <p>“Splendid!” she cried, examining the tag and seeing $7.50. Then she
        passed it round. “Beautiful!” said the women, seeing $7.50.</p>
      <p>And the corruption of Euchretown was accomplished.</p>
      <p>We pass hastily to the strange fury in its later vigor. From the night
        of the initiative prize an extraordinary inflation went on apace.
        Scarcely had a week elapsed (full of gossip at the Stoker’s indubitable
        success) when Mrs. Wheelock gave a second euchre-party. And when the
        guests flocked to the banker’s two-story house in the mission style (on
        the fifty-foot lot which he bought for $1,400 of Jeffreys Sassy), they
        were yet more morally poisoned to observe, on the cut-glass dish which
        she awarded to shrieking Mrs. Botts, the half-extinguished price-mark,
        $9.65.</p>
      <p>For six days, $9.65 was a sort of tag to the town’s mental status;
        when, to the thrilling of all, Mrs. George Botts did suddenly cast out
        invitations; and at Mrs. Bott’s brilliant affair, Mrs. Stoker, after a
        dashing race neck-and-neck with six women who all but beat her, won a
        clock on the bottom of which, mysteriously blurred, the figures $13.75
        could, after careful scrutiny, be distinguished.</p>
      <p>The value of the prize at the fourth party was $15; at the sixth, $19;
        at the ninth, $25.50. Agape, the town stared ahead at its coming dizzy
        course. Then Mrs. Samuel Lethwait, taciturn woman, stupefied the
        inhabitants of the place by making one flying leap from $25 to $50. Out
        of the ranks, out of the number of the unfeared had Mrs. Lethwait made
        her daring rise.</p>
      <p>There was an instant’s recoil. Could Mrs. Stoker, Mrs. Wheelock, Mrs.
        Botts pause now? Their shoulders were at the wheel, their hands on the
        flying plow which tore up such amazing furrows in the social field. The
        recoil was but momentary. At the very hour when Mrs. Botts was putting
        on her hat, sworn to buy a prize worth $60, there fell into her agitated
        hand an invitation. Mrs. Stoker had sprung to the breach.</p>
      <p>A scramble for the cottage of the nine pillars. And behold on the
        golden lamp there displayed as prize, were the shameless figures,
        $75.00.</p>
      <p>Now had the insanity taken general root. He who fails to understand
        knows not California. The dangerous mania once contracted, no matter
        what its form, must continue till the collapse. If the gold fury of ’49,
        and the equally furious land boom of ’87, are not object-lessons enough,
        let the sociologist recall the Belgian hares. And if yet he doubts the
        historical verity of such a cast in the California mind, let him give
        this euchre boom his careful consideration. As men bid for twenty-five
        foot lots in San Diego in the insane days of ’87, so did women now bid,
        under the thin disguise of euchre prizes, for choice positions in the
        social field of Euchretown. It was the old disease.</p>
      <p>In two more leaps the prizes had advanced to a hundred. And, most
        significant of all, seldom was the price of a prize now paid down. The
        credit system had saved the day. The people of Euchretown were not
        millionaires. Few felt able to toss out a hundred with this rapid
        periodicity. So small first payments, contracts, “the rest in six and
        twelve,” became the rule.</p>
      <p>In the rear dust of this race, panting, tagged Mrs. Hummel. Again and
        again, contrary to the will of pained Mr. Hummel (who to himself sang
        “Throw Out the Life Line” in despair), did she attend, punch cards, look
        on with jealous eye; yet she did not play. She was a buffer whom the
        sinners held between their gaming and their consciences. Oh, how she
        longed to give a party that would stagger the general mind!</p>
      <p>Now for a fatal three weeks Mr. Hummel was in Oregon. Two sleepless
        nights his wife spent tossing, then arose feverish, stood on the high
        pinnacle of temptation, and plunged down.</p>
      <p>First she went for a prize. The price had risen to a hundred and forty;
        she must act quick; now!&#8212;lest she be ruined, for the boom waited
        for no man. At a furniture store she asked information on the contract
        system. The dealer (who had furnished prizes) was confused; he could not
        accept the Hummel’s contract. Why? she gasped. Oh, he hastened, it was
        not for doubts of the Hummel honesty; it was for doubts of the honesty
        of the community. In the present furious state he did not believe the
        Hummels would get their salary! Infinitely sorry, infinitely polite was
        he; and she went away dazed. </p>
      <p>But she would do it or die. One more hour of suffering brought her
        back. </p>
      <p>“I’ll mortgage our household goods,” said she, dry-eyed, “till Hummel
        returns.” And he agreed.</p>
      <p>So, Mrs. Stoker’s old slain rival rose up astonishing over the horizon.
        The chill that ran through the community with Mrs. Hummel’s invitations,
        gave way to white heat, and everybody, euchre mad, now rushed to the
        preacher’s home.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Hummel’s struggles had been heroic; the house was decorated as
        never before, the refreshments were beyond any that Mrs. Stoker had
        conceived. And on the portières (given as a prize) the mark one hundred
        and fifty dollars stook forth a challenge.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Stoker, playing recklessly, lost; and her drawn face suggested
        nervous collapse and thoughts criminal. But a crisis in the social life
        of Euchretown was now imminent. There was yet another element to Mrs.
        Hummel’s victory; a murmur went round of the coming ruin of Stoker. As
        ladies moved to tables they eyed Mrs. Stoker, and whispered gossip; as
        men sat down they hinted at revelations, speaking in one another’s ears.
      </p>
      <p>“What is it?” whispered Mrs. Hummel, huskily, to Mrs. Wheelock.</p>
      <p>“They say that Stoker is found out; that he gave false title to some
        land!” </p>
      <p>At that moment Stoker’s wild, unnatural laugh was heard.</p>
      <p>In the final neck-and-neck sprint to the goal, Mrs. Stoker, gone to
        pieces, wretched, was distanced; Mrs. Botts carried off the portières;
        the party broke up, and Mrs. Hummel’s night of sinful conquering passed
        into history. </p>
      <p>When Hummel returned, the news emaciated him. He went to bed and lay
        ill for a week, and nobody threw out the life line to him. Nay, even the
        bed he lay on came near to being snatched from under him. And now, with
        the boom trembling on the verge of collapse, with everybody’s contracts
        coming due, bills began to rain upon the preacher’s head.</p>
      <p>“Jennie,” groaned he, “you have ruined me. See, they haven’t paid my
        salary, and the furniture man is mad. We will be cast into the street!”
      </p>
      <p>Then there fell into Mrs. Hummel’s hands an envelope&#8212;“Mrs.
        Stoker&#8212;at home&#8212;Friday night&#8212;euchre!”</p>
      <p>“Why,” cried Mrs. Wheelock, bursting in with Mrs. Botts, “everybody
        knows that the Stokers are on the brink of ruin. They say he is fighting
        like mad to keep his head up&#8212;maybe to keep out of jail! This is
        their final fling. And everybody has learned about her prize. Guess what
        it is!”</p>
      <p>“And guess what it cost!” shouted Mrs. Botts.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t be un-Christian about it,” declared Jennie, “but I do think
        swindlers had better hide their heads. What is the thing, then, and what
        does it cost?”</p>
      <p>There was an impressive hush.</p>
      <p>“A bedroom set worth two hundred! And she’s let everybody know that she
        paid cash down for it.”</p>
      <p>They all gazed at one another, the fire of gaming in their eyes. </p>
      <p>“She is making one last grand play,” said they.</p>
      <p>One day of gloom did Mrs. Hummel pass in Hummel’s bedroom, arguing,
        pleading. To Hummel, he and the whole town were gone to the devil. </p>
      <p>“No! Never!” cried he, receiving more duns, and shaken.</p>
      <p>But at last toward night he arose and, haunted, went to the furniture
        store. In the window was the bedroom set, and over it a sign, “The prize
        for Mrs. Stoker’s euchre-party.” Staring, the emaciated Hummel lost his
        soul.</p>
      <p>“Would it cover the bill,” he whispered, hoarsely, in the dealer’s back
        room, “if we won it?”</p>
      <p>“About,” mused the dealer; “Hummel, since it’s you. I’d call it
        square.” </p>
      <p>And Hummel returned, unsteady on his feet.</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>Once again the cottage of the Corinthian pillars shone with the
        brilliancy of a euchre evening. Stoker was making a high play to-night
        to keep his footing with the men. Mrs. Stoker had rouged to hide the
        pallor of her cheeks. The house distanced all previous efforts in its
        decorations, the refreshments were beyond the experience of the most
        high-rolling citizen of the town.</p>
      <p>Behold, in came Mrs. Hummel, her blood up.</p>
      <p>“And dear Mr. Hummel?” asked Mrs. Stoker, taking Mrs. Hummel’s hand in
        both of hers.</p>
      <p>“Hummel’s in bed,” said Jennie, tersely; “Mrs. Stoker, I’ll play
        to-night.” </p>
      <p>A moment’s silence, as of a solitude; then a great hubbub, the guests
        making for tables.</p>
      <p>“So glad!” cried Mrs. Stoker; “we’ve always hoped you would!”</p>
      <p>“So glad!” shrieked all the women into Mrs. Hummel’s ear; and the games
        began.</p>
      <p>Why dwell on the mad scramble? That night was the culmination.
        Disgraceful as was the thing in itself, it pales before the disgrace
        incident to a mood of reckless confession which seized the company.
        Somebody blurted out that she’d win that two hundred or die. Then a nigh
        insane man in a corner shouted across the room, to the shocking of all:
        “Let’s make it poker!”</p>
      <p>The laugh that greeted this was spasmodic; and all at once right before
        Mrs. Hummel on the central table, Mr. Stoker, as though he had lost his
        mind, and grown wild and cynical, began to deal out&#8212;ten-dollar
        bills from his deck. These Mr. Wheelock snatched up and shook aloft with
        fearful merriment under the chandelier.</p>
      <p>In that instant the boom collapsed. Who could predict the psychological
        moment? The sight of the ten-dollar bills was too much. Shame rushed
        into every breast; the reaction began; and henceforth in the hands of
        everybody but Mrs. Hummel (who, brain on fire, had failed to catch the
        significance of the moment), euchre fell a limp and lifeless thing.</p>
      <p>And that alone is why the preacher’s wife, who scarcely knew her
        bowers, won the bedroom set.</p>
      <p>A sudden, fierce knocking at the door, and in burst an officer.</p>
      <p>“I have a warrant for the arrest of John Stoker,” said he.</p>
      <p>“I’m here,” said Stoker, sneering and white; and Mrs. Stoker fainted.
      </p>
      <p>Everybody stared; all seized hats; like rats the euchre players slunk
        away; the Corinthian cottage, like a bedizened but deserted courtesan,
        stood gaudily shining in the night, alone.</p>
      <p>Later the town awoke, as the high-roller awakes next morning with a
        suffering and repentant head, and the readjustment began. Everybody owed
        somebody for prizes, as, in ’88, everybody owed somebody for lots.
        Everybody was a buffer to everybody. The thing let itself down and
        evened itself up, and nobody was hard on anybody. And thus the euchre
        boom passed into history.</p>
      <p>Now the church people began to rehabilitate their consciences. And
        Banker Wheelock hit upon a scheme. As financier of the bankrupt soul,
        Wheelock will ever stand out a genius.</p>
      <p>“Why,” said he to Botts, “we did it to help Hummel.”</p>
      <p>“True,” said Botts, dazzled; “let’s go and tell him.”</p>
      <p>And on a Saturday evening a score of citizens came to Hummel’s house.
      </p>
      <p>Hummel was lying pallid on a lounge.</p>
      <p>“We’ve come,” said Wheelock, blandly, “to felicitate you. We couldn’t
        bear to see you carry that debt, Hummel. We fixed the little thing in
        what was, I agree, an unprecedented way. But when we schemed beforehand
        with Mrs. Stoker to give a party and pass the victory on to your
        wife&#8212;Hummel, my friend, our hearts went with it!”</p>
      <p>And Hummel, seeing this astonishing loophole for them all, arose to
        greet the general smile.</p>
      <p>“Kind friends,” said he, in trembling relief, “more blessed is it to
        give than to receive.”</p>

        title='The Sorcery of Asenath'>THE SORCERY OF ASENATH</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Maria Roberts</div>
      <p>People often ask me why I gave up a promising business career and
        devoted myself to traveling, in which I find no pleasure; exploring, for
        which I have no taste; and archæology, which is to me the most tiring of
        pursuits. The question has never been answered, save by the statement
        that there is no reason to give, which involves the telling of an
        incredible story.</p>
      <p>There are two or three to whom I would like to tell it. If they survive
        me, they shall know&#8212;to that end, these pages.</p>
      <p>It is my conviction that whatever intelligent man has known, he has
        tried to record in some way&#8212;that living truths, new to us, may be
        gleaned from the stone tablets of races extinct for ages. For such a
        truth, I am searching. One man found it, but he is dead. His spirit I
        have called up, as the woman at Endor called up Samuel, and questioned
        it. He told me that the knowledge had sent it to the world of shades
        before its time, and had put power into the hands of an evil one, who
        had bidden it never in any place to reveal to any mortal what it knew.
      </p>
      <p>“Even yet I must obey her,” said the spirit of Paul Glen; “but what you
        seek is written.”</p>
      <p>As yet, I have not read. Many strange things have I unearthed, but
        never this that I seek.</p>
      <p>Now, I will write my story. You who read it may believe or not, as you
        see fit. I know that it is true.</p>
      <p>It is many years now since I went South to visit my sister Helen. I had
        not seen her since the day of her marriage, three years before, till she
        met me at the door of her own home and welcomed me in her old sweet and
        quiet manner. It seemed to me, at the first glance, that her face had
        aged too much, and that a certain once fine expression&#8212;a
        suggestion of latent determination&#8212;had overdeveloped, and marked
        her with stern lines. From the first moment, too, I feared the existence
        of a trouble in her life, of which her letters had given no hint.</p>
      <p>She seemed, though, cheerful enough. She led the way into a great room
        that was shaded and cool and full of the scent of lilacs. With a motion
        of her hand, she dismissed three or four black maids, whom she had been
        assisting or instructing at some sewing work, and they went out,
        courtesying and showing their white, even teeth at the door.</p>
      <p>A fourth did not leave, but retired to a far end of the room and went
        on with the sewing. I noticed what a tiny garment she was making, and
        what a sharply cut silhouette her face made against the white curtain of
        the window by which she sat. </p>
      <p>Helen chatted away, apologizing for her husband’s absence, asking a
        host of questions, and planning some pleasure for every one of the days
        of my stay with her. I lay back in my chair, with a feeling of languid
        content, and listened. When Helen suggested sleep and refreshment, I
        declined both, feeling no need of anything but her presence and that
        delicious room, the atmosphere of which was laden with rest as with the
        scent of the lilacs.</p>
      <p>The black woman sat directly in the line of my vision, and I remember
        now that my gaze never strayed from her. I noticed, idly at first, then
        with interest, the regularity of her features and the grand proportions
        of her head and bust. Her hair, brownish in color, with dull copper
        tints, was as straight as my own, and she had a hand and arm so
        perfectly molded that, except for their black skin, they might have been
        those of a lady of high degree. But it was the pride, speaking from
        every line of that dark face, that most attracted my notice. There was
        in it, too, an exultant sense of power, and it was the most resolute
        face, black or white, that I ever saw. </p>
      <p>Presently I began to feel that it required an effort to keep the thread
        of what Helen said, and to reply. Her voice seemed to get faint, then to
        come in snatches, with an indistinct murmur between them; at last, not
        at all, though I knew she was still speaking.</p>
      <p>I was not unconscious, but perception was contracted and concentrated
        upon one abnormal effort. From me a narrow path of light stretched down
        the room to the black woman. She seemed to expand and to grow luminous;
        a vapor exhaled from her, floated to the middle of the pathway, and
        there assumed her own form, almost nude, perfect like her face in its
        every line, motionless as if carved from ebony, but with fierce, impure
        eyes that looked straight into mine and from which there seemed to be no
        escape.</p>
      <p>Their gaze begot an overwhelming sense of disgust. My soul shuddered,
        but my body could not move. The evil face smiled. A cloud floated over
        the form of ebony, slowly passed away, revealing one like polished
        ivory, but the eyes changed not. </p>
      <p>How long their gaze held me motionless and helpless I do not know.
        Suddenly, something white shut out the vision, and my sister’s voice,
        now harsh and loud, struck upon my hearing like a lash. Instantly the
        room assumed its ordinary appearance, the scent of the lilacs greeted me
        as if I had newly come into the atmosphere, and Helen, in her white
        dress, stood before me, trembling.</p>
      <p>The negress at the window looked at us both with insolent amusement. It
        was to her that Helen spoke.</p>
      <p>“How dared you!” she exclaimed; “oh, that I could punish you as you
        deserve!”</p>
      <p>The girl smiled and slowly drew her needle through the cloth in her
        lap. </p>
      <p>“Go out to Lucas,” commanded Helen. “Go!”</p>
      <p>The girl drew herself up, and her face took on an expression of sullen
        defiance. It seemed for an instant that she would not obey. She clenched
        her hands, and I heard her teeth grate together. But she hesitated only
        a moment, then went slowly out of the room. Presently she passed by the
        window, pushing a heavy barrow full of earth. Lucas, the gardener,
        followed, carrying a long gad. In a minute or two they passed again,
        going in the same direction, and afterward again and again. The girl was
        pushing the barrow around and around the house.</p>
      <p>“That is the heaviest and most menial employment I can devise for her,”
        said Helen; “I wish there were something worse. She grows more impudent
        every day, but this is the first time she has dared to exert her snaky
        power upon a white person in my presence. How did you feel while you
        were under that spell?”</p>
      <p>“Now, Helen, for heaven’s sake don’t imagine&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>“I imagine nothing,” she interrupted, in a low voice. “I know that
        girl. She can do strange things. If ever a human creature was possessed
        of a devil, she is.”</p>
      <p>“Why, Helen!”</p>
      <p>She went on without heeding my astonishment. “Every negro on the
        plantation, except Lucas, is mortally afraid of her. My birds cower in a
        corner of their cage if she approaches them, the gentlest horse we have
        will rear and kick at sight of her, and if she goes into the
        poultry-yard the hens cover up their chicks as if night had come. She
        has affected others as she did you. She has done worse. When I first
        came here, she was given to me for a maid; but, not liking her, I took a
        little mulatto girl who was bright and smart then, but who is now
        idiotic through fear of Asenath.”</p>
      <p>I did not think it best to dispute with Helen, knowing her well enough
        to be sure that any argument I could adduce against her belief she had
        already weighed and found wanting. She was not a superstitious woman,
        nor a hasty one, but one whose very mistakes deserved respect, since she
        always took that course of action which she believed to be wisest and
        best, even if it were to her own disadvantage. I simply asked: “Why do
        you not get rid of her?”</p>
      <p>“I have tried, but something frustrates every effort of that kind.
        Robert objects to sale&#8212;it is unusual on this plantation. We once
        offered her her freedom if she would go away; but she only looked as if
        she scorned the freedom we could give, and laughed in a way that chilled
        my blood.”</p>
      <p>“She seems very insolent.”</p>
      <p>“Insolent&#8212;that is a weak word! I sometimes think she is
        birth-marked with impudence as she is with straight hair.”</p>
      <p>“That hair, then, is a birth-mark? I thought it must be a wig.”</p>
      <p>“She was born with it and with an insane craving to be white. When a
        child, she used to scream and shriek over her blackness for hours at a
        time. Mother Glen whipped that out of her.”</p>
      <p>“It is a pity she did not whip out some of her other peculiarities.”
      </p>
      <p>“Mother Glen was much to blame for some of them. You knew Paul Glen,
        and what a strange, silent being he was&#8212;always absorbed in some
        mysterious pursuits, roving from one lost region to another, coming
        home, now and then, for a day and leaving, as if for a short time, to be
        heard of after months of inquiry in Hyderabad, or Jerusalem, or the
        heart of Guinea. Well, after he came home the last time he made Asenath
        the subject of numerous psychological experiments. He could mesmerize
        any one&#8212;what other gifts he had is not known; but he called
        mesmerism child’s play. Mother Glen did not object to his making this
        use of the girl, because she did not wish to cross Paul and have him go
        away again. It is my belief that Asenath discovered, through some of his
        experiments, the existence of an occult power in herself. Before long,
        she had Paul completely under her control. I had not yet come here; but
        Mother Glen told me about it, and that any effort to break the spell
        made Paul perfectly furious. He taught her to read, and to sing, and
        obeyed her in everything&#8212;think of it! After a while he fell sick,
        but it was thought not dangerously. Asenath nursed him, and he would not
        eat or drink unless she bade him.”</p>
      <p>“That, though, may have been a mere whim, such as the sick often take.”
      </p>
      <p>She shook her head. “You have not heard all: Two of the
        servants&#8212;Mammy Clara and Belinda&#8212;declare that they overheard
        Asenath forbid Paul ever to touch food again, and tell him that she
        would pretend to bid him eat, but he must not do so. And it is certainly
        true that he at last refused all sustenance and died of starvation.”</p>
      <p>“What a horrible idea!”</p>
      <p>“Shortly before Paul was stricken down,” Helen proceeded, “he disposed
        of all his property&#8212;it was in securities of various
        kinds&#8212;and we have never been able to find out what he did with the
        money he received. Thousands and thousands of dollars took wing somehow.
        It was never brought here, so she could not have stolen it actually, but
        I am as sure that Asenath knows where that money is as I am that I
        live.”</p>
      <p>“Now, Helen, be sensible, do.”</p>
      <p>“Mother Glen was a sensible woman, and she believed as I do. She said
        the girl was uncanny. Moreover, she declared to me that Asenath had set
        out to conquer her as she did Paul, and that it was only by constant
        resistance that she prevented her from gaining her object. There was a
        psychic contest between them. Mother Glen’s brain was in a condition of
        siege for months. It could not stand the strain. She was seized with
        paralysis and died. I blame Asenath for her death.” </p>
      <p>I did not say much in reply. My odd experience of a few minutes before
        puzzled me. Helen’s account of the girl threw a weird light upon what I
        felt bound, as a reasonable man, to consider merely curious phenomena,
        subjective in character and due to some unexplained physical cause. I
        determined to say a few decided words to Robert Glen about the
        culpability of allowing his delicate wife to contend with such an
        annoyance as Asenath, who, if not a sorceress, certainly was a fractious
        and troublesome servant.</p>
      <p>“It is strange that Robert does not remove her,” said I.</p>
      <p>Helen’s face flushed and was drawn by a momentary spasm. She looked at
        me in troubled silence, as if she could not decide to speak what she
        wished to tell me.</p>
      <p>“I am afraid for Robert,” she said at length, almost in a whisper;
        “there is something in that girl’s demeanor to him that it sickens me to
        think of&#8212;and which I dare not try to explain, even to myself. It
        seems impossible that she can dare to think that he”&#8212;she went on
        hurriedly, after a pause&#8212;“you see, he believes in no psychic
        powers and is not on his guard. He calls her unearthly pranks mere
        mischief that a few years’ discipline will take out of her. Robert
        intends her to marry Lucas.”</p>
      <p>She spoke the last sentence quite loudly, and, as the girl and her
        driver were passing by the window, they overheard. Lucas, a squat,
        stolid-looking mulatto, with a face like that of a satiated animal,
        chuckled and poked at Asenath with the gad.</p>
      <p>The girl stopped. She threw down her burden, flung back her head, and
        turned upon Helen a wild and vicious stare. Her face, streaming with
        perspiration, was full of threat. She gasped for breath from emotion or
        the heaviness of her toil. She raised one hand, wiped her brow with its
        open palm, and flung the drops of sweat in a shower at Helen.</p>
      <p>“May every drop curse you!” she said, between her labored breaths. </p>
      <p>Helen looked at her with quiet scorn. “Go on, Lucas,” she said, calmly.
      </p>
      <p>Asenath shook herself, like a chained animal. She ground her teeth and
        turned upon Lucas in fury, as if she would rend him. He did not quail,
        but raised his gad threateningly and pointed to the barrow-handles, and,
        after a momentary struggle with herself, the girl took them up and went
        on, panting under her toil.</p>
      <p>“She shall continue that until she drops,” said my sister.</p>
      <p>“But, Helen, that surely is cruel.”</p>
      <p>“Not more so than drawing the fangs of a snake. I have discovered that
        she is psychically powerless when physically exhausted. All the negroes
        on the place know this and are rejoicing now&#8212;they all feel more
        secure for knowing that she has been disciplined.”</p>
      <p>While she was speaking, I saw Robert Glen coming along the walk to the
        house. Helen saw him, too. Leaning out the window, she called to Lucas
        and bade him take his charge “to the old barn.” He hurriedly departed,
        driving the girl&#8212;who now seemed doubly unwilling to drag her
        load&#8212;literally like an ox, and very unsparing of the gad.</p>
      <p>Robert greeted me cordially; but it was evident to me that there was a
        cloud between his wife and him. His ruddy face assumed a stern
        expression when he looked at her, and his voice had a hard tone when he
        addressed her. Her manner to him had an appealing, almost fawning, air,
        which it distressed me to see.</p>
      <p>It was some days before I found a chance to speak to Robert on the
        subject of the girl. I had better have held my tongue, for he was
        nettled in an instant, shrugged his shoulders, and curled his lip. </p>
      <p>“You Northern people know nothing whatever about the management of
        slaves. Helen leads that girl the life of a toad under a harrow, because
        the other darkies say she ‘hoodoos’ them, and because my mother had some
        irrational ideas about demoniacal possession. I declare to you, Tom,
        that if I did not know Helen’s delicate condition and nervousness were
        much to blame, I should be ashamed of her treatment of Asenath, who is a
        good house-servant, and valuable.”</p>
      <p>“But she is an annoyance that Helen should not have to contend with
        now.” </p>
      <p>“How is she to be got rid of?” he demanded, impatiently. “We never sell
        any of the people on this estate, and she won’t take her freedom as a
        gift. I can’t kill her.”</p>
      <p>Then I dropped the subject. When I next saw Helen, she had been crying,
        and she begged me not to speak to Robert about the girl again.</p>
      <p>I saw no more of Asenath for some time, and learned that she had been
        put steadily to work at the loom, the day following my arrival. </p>
      <p>One morning, news came that the loom-house had been entered in the
        night, all the yarn carried off, the woven cloth cut to pieces, and the
        loom and wheels so shattered that new ones would be necessary. Even the
        walls of the building were half-destroyed.</p>
      <p>“This is some of Asenath’s work,” said Helen.</p>
      <p>Robert, who had been annoyed by the news, now seemed additionally so.
      </p>
      <p>“Pshaw, Helen!” he said sharply; “it would take the strength of several
        men to do some of this mischief.”</p>
      <p>“She has it at command. Lucas shall take her in hand again.”</p>
      <p>“No, we will have no more of that,” Robert said, sternly. “Now, hear
        me, Helen; I have told Lucas that if he obeys you in that respect again
        he shall be flogged within an inch of his life, and I mean it.”</p>
      <p>Helen’s face turned very white, her hands fell into her lap, and she
        sat as if stricken helpless and hopeless. I hastened away to avoid
        hearing more, comprehending now what the trouble in my sister’s life
        was, and with a presentiment of coming evil that would be greater.</p>
      <p>It was that very night that, having strolled into the shrubbery to
        smoke my cigar, I fell asleep upon a rustic bench there and awoke to
        find it was late at night, with the wind moaning as if a storm were
        brewing in the cloudy heavens.</p>
      <p>As I arose to go to the house, something&#8212;that was not
        visible&#8212;seemed to come from every quarter at once and smite me. I
        felt a sharp, electric thrill, which was followed by a sensation as if I
        had been flung from a height and raised up again, with some of my
        faculties benumbed by the fall. My hair stood up, but I felt no fear,
        only a passive wonder, mixed with expectation. Turning, I saw, by a
        transient gleam of moonlight, the girl Asenath, standing in the path
        near by, pointing at me with a long, slender rod. The ray passed and
        left a black Shadow there, which moved slowly away, beckoning to me. I
        followed.</p>
      <p>The Shadow led me out of the shrubbery and along the wide avenue
        between the two rows of huts occupied by the negroes, and ended at the
        mansion house. I had no will or thought but to follow it exactly. It
        stopped before one of the huts and bent itself nearly double. I, too,
        bent over, involuntarily, and every muscle of my body seemed to become
        tense. The perspiration started out of me, and my will was like a bar of
        steel ending in great fingers, which grasped something and pulled upon
        it with such force that my inner self was a-tremble with weakness when
        the tension relaxed, which it did at the opening of the cottage door and
        the coming out of a little lad&#8212;a mere child&#8212;who looked
        ghastly, as one of the dead walking. He placed himself beside me, we
        followed the shadowy woman to another house, dragged at the invisible
        cords of another human soul, and brought it out into the night. It was a
        woman, this time, in scantiest of night-robes.</p>
      <p>And so we went on, stopping at every door, and from every door some one
        came forth, except from that of Lucas. There, grasp as it would, the
        steel fingers clutched nothing, and the door remained shut.</p>
      <p>The woman Asenath muttered to herself, and all the crowd of followers
        muttered, too. With them, my own lips formed words, of which I did not
        then comprehend the meaning: “Soulless beast!” We went on beyond the
        quarters, stopped at the mansion, and dragged at something that resisted
        with all its strength, which was weaker than ours, for it yielded at
        last, and came slowly, slowly down the steps and stood among us. It was
        my sister Helen. </p>
      <p>Asenath laughed, and ghastly laughter broke from all, even from Helen
        herself.</p>
      <p>I had no feeling of compassion for her, nor of fear for her or myself,
        but was simply a force which another exerted. The wills of those who
        followed Asenath were but strands in the cable of her power, and their
        strength was in her hands for good or ill.</p>
      <p>We followed again&#8212;out of the plantation, through a forest of
        pines, over a bridge that spanned slow-crawling, black water, past a
        fallen church, surrounded by forgotten graves, to the top of a hill
        where there were stones laid in the form of a serpent&#8212;a great
        cleft stone, like open jaws, forming the head. There Asenath paused and
        cast down her rod. She stretched out her hands, and in a moment we were
        formed into a circle about the rod. </p>
      <p>And then once again those fingers of steel grasped
        something&#8212;something that all their strength seemed unable to move.
        Our breath came in gasps, our forms shook like the leaves of the aspen
        tree, and in the heart was a fear, too great to be measured, of failure.
        Long, long the effort lasted&#8212;lasted until the will seemed to
        discard its own puerile strength and to fling itself upon the bosom of
        impersonal force, seize the reservoir of the universal will, and turn
        its power in a mighty stream upon the burden of one desire&#8212;one
        unyielding demand that the door be opened. And with that borrowed force
        came the sense of unlimited strength. Faith was born. We stretched out
        our arms in gestures of which I can only remember that they were first
        those of invitation, then of welcome. Nature began to pulsate. There was
        a sound like the slow, regular beating of a heart, in the chambers of
        which we were inclosed. The inner life throbbed with it so fiercely that
        the blood seemed almost to leap from my body. All about us were the
        movements of awakening birds and insects; from afar came the lowing of
        kine, the crowing of cocks, and the crying of children, as if they were
        suddenly startled into fear. </p>
      <p>In the centre of the circle appeared a square of strange light. We
        looked upon it and beheld a place of which the darkness and the light of
        this world are but the envelopes. We saw there, afar off, a vast
        crystalline globe, from which extended, in all directions, millions of
        filaments of clear light. The globe scintillated as a diamond does, and
        its sparks floated away upon the endless filaments of light. Nearer to
        us, moving about, were beings not human, and not resembling each other
        further than that they were all gigantic and all possessed of some human
        attributes. Some were beautiful, some hideous; but upon every one was
        stamped&#8212;in strange characters that I somehow understood&#8212;the
        words “<i>I only am God</i>.” Upon some the writing was fantastic, as if
        put on in mockery. Upon others it shone with a clear and cruel radiance
        that pained the sight. Some bore it faded and dim, as if the pretension
        it set up had fallen like a leaf into the stream of the ages and been
        almost forgotten. A great awe fell upon us all, so great that all,
        except the woman Asenath and myself, fell down and seemed as if dead.
        The woman trembled and murmured to herself, and again my lips formed her
        words: “Is it worth while, when human desires are so poor, human life so
        short?”</p>
      <p>Through that door there floated not a voice, for the silence was only
        broken by a faint, soft hum, like very distant music, but an unspoken
        command that impressed itself upon the spirit.</p>
      <p>“<i>Speak!</i>”</p>
      <p>Still the woman hesitated. Suddenly her lips moved again, mine
        following them: “But only through this can <i>he</i> be won.”</p>
      <p>“I would have the desire of my heart,” she said aloud.</p>
      <p>“<i>It is thine</i>,” was the silent answer; “<i>to him who knocks at
          this door shall it be opened, and what he asks for there shall he
          receive, whether for good or ill. It is the law.</i>”</p>
      <p>“I would be fair, like those who enslave me. All that she
        has”&#8212;she pointed to my sister&#8212;“I would take from her and
        have for my own.”</p>
      <p>“<i>The power to obtain thy will is thine, whether thou be of the just
          or of the unjust. The spirit which commands shall be obeyed. It is the
          law.</i>”</p>
      <p>“And is there a penalty to be paid?”</p>
      <p>“<i>Thy act is the seed from which its penalty shall grow.</i>”</p>
      <p>The woman sighed.</p>
      <p>“What penalty?”</p>
      <p>“<i>Thou knowest the law.</i>”</p>
      <p>Sighing again, bitterly, Asenath stretched out her hand. The square of
        light went out. Across the spot where it had been, drifted indistinct
        forms which passed into invisibility on either side. Under their feet
        ran a serpent of fire, which leaped at the woman. She grasped it, and it
        seemed to become the rod she had cast down. </p>
      <p>I remembered nothing more until I came slowly to myself, stretched upon
        the bench in the shrubbery, with the morning sun shining into my face.
        My limbs were stiff, my head ached, and my heart was heavy with a
        foreboding of evil. It was impossible for me to decide whether the
        experience of the night was a dream or a reality, but I was sorely
        troubled; I could not think of Asenath without a creeping of the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>On approaching the house, I saw Robert standing in the doorway. My
        first glimpse of him set me to trembling with fear of evil tidings, he
        looked so agitated and distressed. When he perceived me, he wrung his
        hands and burst into tears.</p>
      <p>“Oh, Tom!” he cried, “Helen is dying. She was taken with convulsions
        early this morning. She does not know me. The baby was born dead, and
        Helen can not live. I must lose her! Oh, God, I must lose her!”</p>
      <p>He ran through the hall and up the stairs, like a wild man. I followed,
        but the heaviness of the shock was so great that it was but slowly and
        with a feeling as if the floor was rising up to my face. Asenath was
        moving stealthily about the hall. I bade her begone. She looked at me
        like a startled cat, but did not go. A black girl, coming down the
        stairs, passed me, and I recognized her as the first of the women who
        had joined our ghastly crowd the night before. She gazed straight before
        her, with wide-open, horrified eyes, and her face had the same pinched
        look the hall mirror had shown me upon my own as I glanced into it
        involuntarily when passing it. At the top of the stairs, Belinda,
        Helen’s poor little maid, flung herself at my feet and clasped my knees.
      </p>
      <p>“Oh, Massa Tom,” she cried, “she am ’witched. Go an’ git d’ witch
        doctah t’&#8212;tak’&#8212;de spell off’n her. Nuffin’ll save her ef yo’
        don’t do dat.”</p>
      <p>As I stopped to put the poor creature aside, old Mammy Clara, her face
        streaming with tears, came up to me.</p>
      <p>“Massa Tom,” she said, solemnly, “de good God hab tooken Miss Helen.
        She’s in heben wid her li’l’ baby.”</p>
      <p>The blow overcame me. It will be best to pass over that time. I shut
        myself into my room and bore my agony alone. I went once into the room
        where Helen lay and looked at her face. It was the face of one in
        peaceful rest, but it had aged twenty years in twelve hours. Her maids,
        directed by Mrs. Grayson, an old friend of the family, were ready to
        prepare her for the grave.</p>
      <p>“They think,” whispered Mrs. Grayson, “that she had walked in her
        sleep. Her feet are scratched and torn, as if she had been among briars
        barefoot, and the doctors say that her convulsions probably came on from
        the shock of awakening. She was found at daybreak, unconscious, in the
        hall, and the outer door was wide open.”</p>
      <p>I left the plantation a few days after the funeral, and for years
        neither saw nor heard directly from Robert Glen. I never could forgive
        his indifference to Helen’s peace of mind while she lived, nor get over
        a certain disgust with which his lack of self-control at the time of her
        death inspired me. I never liked him, and, after that sad time, I had
        less regard for him than ever. I never told him the story I have
        written. He would only have pronounced me mad, and I did not wish to
        obtain that reputation for the mere sake of warning him. Besides, I
        tried with all my mind to believe the experience of that night a dream,
        but I found that impossible and was always looking for a sequel to it.
        The sequel came in its appointed time.</p>
      <p>Years passed away. At the outbreak of the war, the Graysons came North.
        From them, I learned that Asenath had disappeared from the plantation
        long before, and was supposed to have drowned herself in the black creek
        and to haunt the plantation in the form of a black-and-white snake. Dr.
        Grayson blamed himself for her death.</p>
      <p>“Some of the Glen negroes,” he said, “told some of mine that the girl
        was turning white, and that, with the exception of her face and hands,
        her whole body had changed its color. Now I had heard of such cases, but
        never had seen one, and in spite of what Buffon and other naturalists
        say on the subject, felt doubtful of the possibility of such a thing
        taking place. I rode over to Glen’s one day to investigate the matter.
        Glen was not at home; but, presuming upon old friendship with him, I saw
        the girl and told her the object of my call. I wish you had seen her;
        she flew into an outrageous passion, called me vile names, said there
        was not a white spot on her person, and that if I touched her it should
        cost me dear. Of course, I paid no attention to her threats, and called
        that Lucas of Glen’s to help me turn up her sleeves. Her arms really
        were white, but before I could half-examine them, she broke away from us
        and tore out of the house. We followed, but lost sight of her in the
        shrubbery, and to this day she has never been seen again. The negroes
        say she drowned herself. Glen, when he returned, seemed to believe so.
        He took me to task in a most ungentlemanly manner for what had happened,
        and we have not been on speaking terms since. He has now gone abroad to
        stay until this little war squall blows over, I hear.”</p>
      <p>“I trust that he may&#8212;and longer,” I said. The doctor chuckled a
        little and changed the subject. In secret, I said to myself: “I don’t
        believe the girl is dead, and I do believe that Robert Glen knows where
        she is. The sequel will come.”</p>
      <p>In ’68, Robert returned home, bringing a wife with him. He wrote me a
        formal announcement of his marriage, to which I replied with equal
        formality.</p>
      <p>It was rumored that the new wife was rich in her own right; that she
        was of English parentage, but born and reared in Calcutta. Later, I
        heard that Robert’s old neighbors had not taken to her at all, and that
        she had an ungovernable temper, being unable to keep any servant under
        her roof, except a couple of East Indian women, whom she berated
        continually in their own tongue, but who could not speak English enough
        to impart any information about their mistress to her neighbors. </p>
      <p>The year after Robert’s marriage, I accepted an invitation to spend a
        few days with the Graysons. Feeling that I owed Robert the courtesy of a
        call, I rode over to the plantation, not so much to discharge a social
        duty as to see the new Mrs. Glen, about whom I noticed, on the part of
        the Graysons, a marked reluctance to speak. They edged away from the
        subject, when I brought it up, with nervous looks at each other.</p>
      <p>Leaving my horse at the outer gate, I walked along the wide avenue
        nearly to the house. There was a spectral stillness upon the place.
        Sadness exhaled from everything, to be drawn in with every breath. The
        old servants were all gone. I had met the once sleek and stolid Lucas,
        now rheumatic and ragged, begging in the village. Belinda was in the
        county asylum, and the others were scattered or dead. The scent of the
        lilacs was gone from the air&#8212;the very bushes were rooted up, and
        lay, sear and dead, by little heaps of earth. A triangle of cloud in the
        sky cast upon the earth a triangle of shadow, in the midst of which
        Robert Glen’s home lay as if it were entranced. No sign of happy life
        met me; but, as I turned aside to look at a certain bench in the
        shrubbery, a black-and-white snake ran over my foot.</p>
      <p>I went no further. A woman was seated upon the bench&#8212;a fair
        woman, with hair like dull copper reflecting sullen fire, with a face
        and form perfect as those of the goddesses of old, a face which
        betokened an indomitable soul which knew the secret of the power wielded
        by the gods. She was bending over her clasped hands, her face was turned
        aside in an attitude of eager waiting, and wore a smile that
        transfigured it. Slowly approaching her, walking as a man walks in his
        sleep, came Robert Glen. He threw himself at her feet and laid his head
        upon her knee. She bent to him with a little rapturous caress, and both
        faces were as happy as those of the people in Paradise.</p>
      <p>I turned and went away from the place, and entered its precincts no
        more. From that hour, I was self-devoted to one purpose&#8212;to seek
        the knowledge that should open the door to her degradation and
        destruction. In the midst of her success, and in the height of her
        pride, she should turn black as she was in the day when Lucas drove her.
        I swore it. So should my friend and my sister, whom she robbed and slew,
        be avenged. </p>

        title='Old “Hard Luck”'> OLD “HARD LUCK”</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By E. Munson</div>
      <p>Every one admitted he had a good heart in him. Even his bitterest
        enemy, Kid Alderson, was willing to make that concession, but qualified
        it by adding that he “was so blamed unlucky and peculiar, a body never
        knowed when he <i>was</i> in to clear.”</p>
      <p>This singularity extended to his name. “H-o-s-s-e-l-k-u-s, accent on
        the <i>sel</i>,” he was wont to explain, with something like a shade of
        weariness, when a new operator faltered on his long patronymic.</p>
      <p>Eben J. Hosselkus was engineer of Engine Seventeen-Forty-Three.</p>
      <p>With the meagre data available, it is difficult to determine whether
        the name Hosselkus belongs to the Anglo-Saxon, Indo-European, or
        Teutonic family; but no such uncertainty attached to the origin of its
        unfortunate bearer. He was an unmistakable Yankee; rather below the
        medium height, lean and wiry; his mild, light-blue eyes were
        overshadowed by bushy and frowning eyebrows, and his grizzled mustache
        bristled with a singular ferocity, which the weakness of mouth and chin
        immediately belied. The whole man was decidedly contradictory. When
        first addressed, his manner was brusque and his voice gruff; but, after
        a few terrible expletives, his tone would soften and his most positive
        assertions invariably ended with an appeal for confirmation. “Now ain’t
        it so, for a fact? Now wouldn’t you say so, ’f you’uz me?” he would ask,
        while his wistful eyes wandered from face to face in search of support
        or sympathy, perhaps.</p>
      <p>He was the oldest engineer on the division, and the most unfortunate.
        Two decades of brakemen and conductors had twisted and distorted his
        luckless surname in every conceivable way; but to all appellations, from
        “Old Hoss” to “Hustle-Cuss,” he ever accorded the same ready response.
      </p>
      <p>Of late years he had been known simply as “Hard Luck.” When a
        train-crew would reach the end of the division, wan and famished from a
        protracted sojourn at some desert-siding, the first inquiry of their
        sympathetic brethren would be: “Who was pullin’ you?” “Old Hard Luck, of
        course,” was the seldom varied reply.</p>
      <p>Old Hosselkus had probably suffered more “moving accidents by flood and
        field” than any other man ever lived through. And yet he was a
        thoroughly competent engineer. He was an earnest student of mechanical
        engineering, and could explain the mysteries of “link motion,” the
        principles of the “injector,” and the working of the Westinghouse
        automatic air-brake in a singularly lucid manner. Nothing pleased him
        better than to enlighten a green fireman upon some knotty point, and the
        walls of the roundhouse and bunkhouse are still covered with his
        elaborate chalk and pencil diagrams of the different parts of the
        locomotive.</p>
      <p>As far back as he could remember, it had been the dream of Hosselkus’s
        life to be a regular passenger-engineer&#8212;in railroad parlance, to
        “pull varnished cars.” This was the goal upon the attainment of which
        the best efforts of his life had been concentrated, and still, after
        twenty years’ service, he seemed as far as ever from success. Many times
        he had almost achieved it, but always something had happened to prevent,
        some unaccountable and unavoidable piece of ill-luck. Finally, his name
        became so synonymous with disaster that the “Company” hesitated to
        intrust the valuable equipment of an express-train and the lives of the
        traveling public to him. Thus, as the years went by, old Hard Luck had
        become accustomed to crawling out from under the disgruntled engine of a
        side-tracked worktrain or way-freight to acknowledge the patronizing
        wave of the hand, as some former fireman of his whizzed by with a
        passenger-train or an “officers’ special.” Despair, however, had no
        place in his heart, and he still reveled in the fancied joys of pulling
        the fast express, and dreamed of that happy time when, to the customary
        inquiry as to the time of his departure, he would be able to answer: “I
        go out on Number Three.”</p>
      <p>There is a great difference in engineers; some can step off the
        foot-board at the end of a long run looking as fresh and clean as at the
        start, while, to judge from the appearance of others, one would imagine
        they had made the journey in the ash-pan. Hosselkus belonged to the
        latter class. It would have required some more powerful solvent than
        simple soap and water to have removed the soot and grime that had
        gradually accumulated in the wrinkles and hollows of his countenance
        during the years of arduous service. There was some excuse for him,
        however, seeing that so much of his life had been spent upon
        superannuated “ten-wheelers,” which, as every one knows, are awkward
        machines to oil, on account of their wheels being so low and close
        together. Then, too, he had so many accidents. He scarcely ever made a
        round trip without “slipping an eccentric,” “bursting a flue,” or
        “burning out his grates,” not to mention more serious mishaps, such as
        derailments, head and hind-end collisions, or running into slides and
        wash-outs. Much practice had made him almost perfect in “taking down a
        side,” or disconnecting a locomotive, while some of his exploits in the
        fire-box, plugging flues, rivaled the exhibition given by the Hebrew
        children in that seven times heated furnace of Holy Writ.</p>
      <p>But while his extensive experience upon the road had developed habits
        of self-reliance and a certain readiness in emergencies, it was not
        calculated to impart that gloss or polish which enables one to shine in
        society. Hard Luck’s only appearance within the charmed circle had been
        when he acted as pall-bearer at the funeral of a division
        superintendent, and upon that occasion he had scandalized his colleagues
        by appearing without the conventional white gloves, and a hurried and
        embarrassed search of his pockets only brought to light a bunch of
        “waste” and a “soft hammer,” articles which, though almost indispensable
        on a locomotive, are not essential to the success of a well-ordered
        interment.</p>
      <p>Gamblers say that if one is but possessed of sufficient capital, the
        most persistent run of ill-luck may eventually be broken, and so it
        proved in Hosselkus’s case.</p>
      <p>An “officers’ special,” carrying the leading magnates of the road upon
        a tour of inspection, was expected, and Engine Seven-Seventy-Seven, the
        fastest locomotive on the division, and Bill Pearson, an engineer with a
        record, had been held in readiness for some time to take them out.</p>
      <p>The engine, with a full tank of the best coal, had already been run out
        of the roundhouse, and the train-dispatcher had the freights safely
        side-tracked, and satisfactory “meets” with the passenger-trains about
        figured out, when he was interrupted in his study of the train-sheet by
        a nervous ring at the telephone. The dispatcher answered it himself, and
        the foreman of the roundhouse announced that Pearson was sick, and
        unable to take the special out. </p>
      <p>“That’s bad,” mused the dispatcher, but added, a moment later: “Well,
        send the next best man, and get a move on; they’ll be here in ten
        minutes.”</p>
      <p>“They ain’t none,” replied the roundhouse.</p>
      <p>“No other engineer?” shouted the dispatcher.</p>
      <p>“Well, there’s only Perkins on the yard-engine and Hard Luck just in on
        Scott’s work-train&#8212;might double him out again&#8212;that’s all.”
      </p>
      <p>The dispatcher rushed into the adjoining room to consult the
        superintendent.</p>
      <p>It was in the midst of the busiest season, and every available engineer
        was out upon the road.</p>
      <p>“Hard Luck? nonsense!” said the superintendent when he was informed of
        the situation. “Tell Pearson he must take the special out&#8212;this is
        a nice time for him to get sick!”</p>
      <p>The roundhouse was notified, and replied that Pearson was “foamin’
        awful&#8212;his wife’s got him jacked up and two doctors workin’ on
        him,” yelled the foreman.</p>
      <p>“This is terrible! <i>terrible!</i>” groaned the superintendent.
        “Perkins is only a boy, we can’t put him on, and Hosselkus will never
        get over the division without something happening&#8212;never in the
        world!” and the perspiration started upon his forehead. The whistle of
        the special aroused him to the necessity of immediate action.</p>
      <p>“Tell them to put Hosselkus on, and get him out as quick as
        possible&#8212;we are in the hands of Providence anyway, I suppose,” he
        added to himself.</p>
      <p>All was hurry and excitement when the special pulled in. The engine
        that brought it in was cut off and hurried out of the way, while the
        huge, well-groomed “Three-Sevens” backed slowly down in charge of
        Hosselkus, whose heart swelled chokingly as the brazen clangor of her
        bell pealed out.</p>
      <p>But the beginning was ominous. The engine was unfamiliar to him and
        worked more stiffly than he had expected, so that when he backed down to
        be coupled on, he struck the train with a momentum that jarred its
        occupants uncomfortably.</p>
      <p>“Lord! <i>Lord!</i>” moaned the superintendent as he wiped his clammy
        brow and sought to divert the directors’ attention from the mishap by
        suggesting some needed improvements in the “Company’s” water supply.</p>
      <p>Presently he excused himself and went ahead to the engine to interview
        Hard Luck. He found him with an oil-can in one hand and a bunch of waste
        in the other, engaged in the important duty of “oiling ’round.”</p>
      <p>Hosselkus had had no time to change his greasy jumper and overalls for
        cleaner ones; his hasty wash had merely imparted a smeary look to his
        countenance, and the badge on his cap was upside down, but his eyes
        sparkled beneath their shaggy brows, his mustache bristled savagely, and
        the whole man was nervously alert as, with a squirt of oil here, a dab
        of the waste there, and feeling carefully each key and bearing to detect
        any signs of heating, he worked his way around the mighty racer. He was
        just finishing his round when the superintendent came up.</p>
      <p>“Now, Hosselkus,” said the latter, appealingly, “<i>do</i> be careful
        and try and get us over the division in some kind of shape&#8212;make
        time, and, for heaven’s sake, don’t break down on the road. If you make
        a first-class run, I’ll see what we can do about getting a passenger run
        for you.”</p>
      <p>Hosselkus put away his tallow-pot, wiped his hands on the bunch of
        waste, which he then carefully placed in his pocket to serve as a
        handkerchief, and at length spoke: “Colonel,” he said, “don’t you lose
        no sleep over this excursion&#8212;we’ll git there in the biggest kind
        of shape&#8212;this mill has got it in her, an’ if I can’t coax a move
        out of her, I’ll run a stationary the rest of my life. Now, these
        kid-engineers of yours, they ain’t up in mechanics like they’d oughter
        be&#8212;not but what they’re good boys&#8212;mind you, I’m not sayin’ a
        word agin ’em&#8212;but they waste her stren’th&#8212;they don’t really
        savvy the theory. Now&#8212;&#8212;” </p>
      <p>“Yes, yes,” hurriedly interrupted the superintendent; “I know, but we
        must be getting out of here, and don’t forget that passenger
        run&#8212;it’s manslaughter, if not murder in the first degree,” he said
        to himself, as he hastened back; “but if we escape with our lives, he
        shall have the run.”</p>
      <p>The conductor waved his hand, Hosselkus opened the throttle slightly
        and the steam shrilled through the cylinder-cocks as the special moved
        down the yard. Slowly he threaded the network of tracks, cut-offs, and
        blind switches, and then more rapidly by the long siding opposite the
        row of cottages, where the families of the conductors and engineers
        lived. And instinctively he felt the eyes of the women upon him, and
        that they were saying: “Well, if there ain’t that crazy fool on
        Pearson’s Three-Sevens, with a passenger special! Wouldn’t that kill
        you?” for women are jealous divinities&#8212;they would not that man
        should have any other gods or goddesses before them, and, as Hosselkus
        worshiped only a locomotive, a thing of steel and iron, they made of him
        a by-word and a reproach. But at that moment, Hard Luck cared but little
        for their disdain; he only thought of his triumph, and the discordant
        clanging of the bell of the Three-Sevens sounded in his ears as a pæan
        of victory. “At last&#8212;at last,” seemed to say its brazen tongue.
      </p>
      <p>The last switch was passed, and Hosselkus, forgetting the lightness of
        his train, opened the throttle so suddenly that the engine fairly leaped
        forward, while passengers’ necks received a violent wrench. </p>
      <p>“This engineer of yours, colonel,” said the general superintendent,
        spitting out the end of a cigar he had involuntarily swallowed, “is just
        off a pile-driver, is he not?”</p>
      <p>The colonel laughed a joyless laugh. “The fact is,” he replied, “the
        regular man was taken sick at the last moment, and we had no one but
        this fellow to put on. He is an old engineer, but not used to the
        engine. I think he will improve when he gets the hang of it.” </p>
      <p>“I hope so&#8212;I hope so,” said the general, fervently, as he lit a
        fresh cigar; “there is evidently room for improvement.”</p>
      <p>But presently even the anxious superintendent was forced to admit they
        were moving. Telegraph-poles, that had appeared and disappeared with
        majestic deliberation, began to flit by the windows with a frequency and
        abruptness very unusual in those stately objects; quicker and less
        rhythmic came the click of the wheels as each rail was passed, and the
        leaps of the engine at each revolution of the driving-wheels were merged
        into a continuous, convulsive shudder. The passengers no longer
        experienced the sensation of being drawn along, but felt as though
        projected through space, and the more timid clung to their seats to
        avoid soaring off through the roof. Trainmen who could traverse
        undisturbed the reeling roofs of a fast freight, made their way through
        the swaying cars with difficulty. </p>
      <p>Old Hard Luck was evidently “getting there,” and the superintendent
        prayed silently that he might maintain the speed to the end.</p>
      <p>At the first stop he went forward to congratulate the engineer. The
        fireman was under the engine “hoeing out,” and Hosselkus, sooty but
        triumphant, was “oiling ’round.”</p>
      <p>“How’d’s that suit you, colonel?” he cried, as his superior approached;
        “the old girl’s a-crawlin’, ain’t she?”</p>
      <p>“You’re doing fine, Hosselkus&#8212;fine, but keep it up&#8212;pound
        her on the back, for the porter tells me the wine is getting low and
        they’re liable to see something to beef about. Keep ’em a-rollin’, and
        the passenger run is yours.” The colonel had risen from the ranks, and
        at times, unconsciously, lapsed into the old dialect.</p>
      <p>“Don’t you worry none, we’ll git there. Gimme this mill, colonel, an’
        none of the other boys on the division ’ud ever get a smell of my smoke.
        An’ she does it so easy, reminds of your maw’s old rocker&#8212;just
        handle her right, don’t crowd her, that’s the main point. Now my
        theory’s like this, we’ll say the cylinder receives so
        much&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>But the colonel had fled. Hard Luck carried his theory with him, for he
        never succeeded in obtaining a listener to whom he could expound it.</p>
      <p>No accident occurred, however; the speed was maintained, and the
        special reached Oleson’s Siding so far in advance of the
        train-dispatcher’s calculations that quite a wait was necessary while
        Number Three, the east-bound express, toiled up the grade.</p>
      <p>Hosselkus lit the headlight, for the sun was impaled upon one of the
        peaks of the distant Sierras, whose eastern slopes were already purpling
        with shades of evening.</p>
      <p>It was the last stop. Below him wound the tortuous Goose-Neck Grade,
        with the division terminus at its foot. The run was nearly ended.</p>
      <p>Having finished oiling, Hosselkus leaned against the cylinder-head and
        gazed abstractedly down the track. A brakeman was seated on the
        head-block of the switch, throwing stones at an adjacent telegraph-pole,
        and moodily speculating upon the probabilities of “getting in” in time
        for supper, while an occasional breath of wind from the valley brought
        with it, from far down the grade, the puffing of the engines on Number
        Three.</p>
      <p>He had succeeded. The record would be broken beyond a doubt; but as the
        cool breeze of sunset blew in his face, he suddenly became aware of the
        fact that he was tired, and he remembered then that he had been on the
        road for over forty-eight hours.</p>
      <p>The smell of heated tallow struck him, for the first time, as being a
        singularly unappetizing odor, and he looked over the huge machine with
        something akin to dissatisfaction in the expression of his face. He
        sighed, and the brakeman asked if she was coming&#8212;meaning the
        train.</p>
      <p>“No,” replied Hard Luck; “she ain’t showed up ’round the bend
        yet&#8212;I’uz just thinkin’.”</p>
      <p>“Well, here she’s a-comin’.”</p>
      <p>Hosselkus clambered to his seat, and as soon as the express-train had
        cleared the switch it was opened by the brakeman, and the special was
        once more under way.</p>
      <p>Leaning uncomfortably now to this side, now to that, and with angry
        grinding of flange on rail, it swept around the curves with
        ever-increasing speed. A crashing roar, a flare of yellow sunset light
        reflected from rocky walls, told of a cutting safely passed, while
        bridge, and culvert, and trestle bellowed again as the engine cleared
        them at a bound.</p>
      <p>The Three-Sevens devoured the way. Again and again Hosselkus proved the
        correctness of his theory by the terrific bursts of speed with which the
        mighty engine responded to his every impulse; but his nerves were no
        longer responsive to the exultant thrill of triumph. A sickening
        foreboding griped his heart; yet, whenever he would have shut off steam
        and slackened speed, an unconquerable impulse restrained him; for, in
        the exhaust of the engine and the roar of wheels, he fancied he heard
        one word repeated over and over again, with maddening persistency:
        “Hurry! hurry! hurry! hurry!” And the fireman, as he shoveled in coal
        and struggled to maintain his difficult footing, noted with wonder, not
        unmixed with uneasiness, that Hosselkus was working steam on grades
        where it was usual to “let them down” under the restraining pressure of
        the air-brakes. </p>
      <p>The lagging summer twilight gradually deepened until the illuminated
        faces of clock and steam-gauge stood out with pallid distinctness in the
        gloom of the cab. Lights in lonely section-houses shot past, and
        occasionally a great flare of red rushed upward from the momentarily
        opened door of the fire-box. The dazzling light of the furnace revealed
        old Hard Luck crouching forward on his seat, one hand on the throttle,
        the other grasping the reversing lever. His features were set and
        sharpened, and so pale that through its grimy enameling his face looked
        positively blue. An occasional swift, comprehensive glance took in
        clock, steam-gauge, and water-glass, and then his eyes were again fixed
        upon the arrowy torrent of ties that streamed into the glare of the
        headlight and disappeared beneath the pilot with unbroken, dizzying
        swiftness. At last a white post flitted by and Hosselkus relaxed. He
        glanced at the clock, and the next moment a long, wailing blast of the
        whistle warned the yardmen at the division’s end.</p>
      <p>The record was broken; the passenger run was his at last; old Hard Luck
        had actually got over the division without a mishap and in time never
        before equaled; but instead of exulting over it, as he shut off steam,
        he found himself marveling how faint and far away the whistle had
        sounded; had he not felt the vibration of the escaping steam, he would
        hardly have believed it was the Three-Seven’s stentorian voice.
        Undoubtedly there was something wrong; he would have to fix it the first
        thing in the morning. The engine lurched over the switches, and
        Hosselkus cursed the sudden fog that had dimmed the switch-lamps so he
        could hardly tell red from white, but at length he pulled up before the
        Railway Hotel&#8212;fortune favored him to the last, he made a splendid
        stop. </p>
      <p>With a great sigh of relief he leaned back on his seat, while the
        eating-house gong banged and thundered a hospitable welcome to the
        belated guests.</p>
      <p>“You made a magnificent run, Hosselkus. I’ll fix it with the
        master-mechanic&#8212;you go out on Number Three to-morrow,” called out
        the superintendent, as he hurried by.</p>
      <p>Presently a yardman uncoupled the engine and waved his lantern. “All
        right!” called out the fireman, who was standing in the gangway.</p>
      <p>The engineer made no move.</p>
      <p>“What’s the matter?” inquired the switchman, climbing into the cab;
        “Why in&#8212;&#8212;” The light of his lantern fell upon the engineer’s
        face; he paused suddenly, for it was white beneath the grime.</p>
      <p>Hard Luck was taken from the engine, laid upon a bench, and a physician
        hastily summoned. Engineers, with smoky torches, and trainmen, with
        lanterns, crowded around with bated breath, while the doctor listened
        long and attentively for a sound of life, but only the air-pump on the
        Three-Sevens sighed softly, as the light rings of smoke from her stack
        floated up, and up, and up in the quiet air, where still a tinge of
        twilight lingered.</p>
      <p>“Dead!” said the doctor, and the tension was relaxed.</p>
      <p>Then they all praised their late comrade, and all agreed that the old
        fellow had a good heart in him, anyway&#8212;that is, all but the
        doctor, who, as he rose and carefully wiped his spectacles, muttered
        something about “Organic weakness&#8212;told him so.”</p>
      <p>The next day, as the superintendent had promised, Hard Luck went out on
        Number Three&#8212;but he went in a box, lashed to the platform of the
        baggage-car.</p>

        title='The Dotted Trail'> THE DOTTED TRAIL</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By W. H. Irwin</div>
      <p>The first time that Dudley Latimer kissed Belle Sharp, the half-Spanish
        “help” at the P. L. Ranch, he was not in earnest; he would have been the
        last to say that there was any serious intention in it. He did it partly
        in a spirit of pure bravado, and partly because the morning was as warm
        and white as new milk, and she, smiling back over her shoulder as she
        emptied her pails, looked a part of it. Equally innocent of any harmful
        intent, she let him after a formal struggle. He was tall and clean, and
        as handsome as a young Englishman can be when he is in perfect
        condition, and has a fine, red coat of tan. Then he bade her good-by. He
        had been at the ranch a week, ranging the hills in a vain hunt for
        antelope, already then, in the early eighties, becoming scarce. His
        canvas-covered wagon and his “side partner,” the Hon. Justin Weymouth,
        waited by the gate.</p>
      <p>The Hon. Justin was taking a parting nip with the “Old Man,” and did
        not see the diversion, and none of the four noticed that Emilio Gonolez,
        horse trainer and man-of-all-work, was coming in through the kitchen
        yard carrying an antelope so freshly killed that its throat was not yet
        cut. Emilio stood and watched. He saw the struggle, heard the girl cry
        “The gall of you!” saw her color turn as she lifted her face with
        unwilling willingness, saw her throw at young Latimer, walking away, a
        look of admiration that he took for something else. Then Emilio slipped
        round the barn with his quarry, and came upon the wagon in front. Dudley
        was smiling across the fence at Belle, who had found business in the
        front yard. For half a minute, Emilio looked what he felt; then smiled
        as he slipped into view, and said: “I make-a present you thees antelope.
        He ees fresh. Myself, I shoot heem. He come ver’ close.” </p>
      <p>“Careful how you tie it, Emmy,” said the Old Man. “Dump it in for ’em.
        Well, boys, stacking in the north field. Good-by, and luck to you.”</p>
      <p>While Dudley chatted across the fence with Belle, Emilio was explaining
        to the Hon. Justin how an antelope should be tied and hung for a
        journey. “Head down so he bleed&#8212;the dust bother ver’
        leetle&#8212;oh, yes, a lee-tle cut on the throat so he bleed slow. That
        ees bes’. I cut heem.” A slow, red stream trickled over snowy throat and
        gray jaws. The wagon drove on. Down the road behind it trailed an
        irregular line of wet dots, the centres for an army of noisy flies.</p>
      <p>“Awfully jolly girl,” said Dudley, as they bowled easily along through
        the red dust. The Hon. Justin puffed at his pipe, and made no answer. He
        might have said that he hastened their going just because his companion
        was very young and the girl very pretty. A flock of sage-hens started
        from the olive-green brush to one side. Justin pulled up, took out his
        shotgun and followed, Dudley throwing stones to make them rise. A right
        and left shot brought down a brace. They gathered up the birds, and
        turned to the wagon, and as they did so, the elder man looked back. Just
        level with the ranch house, two miles behind, a cloud of red dust veiled
        the road and lapped far over its edge. Through the thin atmosphere came
        a muffled rumble, and then a few dots, followed at an interval by
        another, heaved out of the mass.</p>
      <p>“Cattle!” said Dudley. “That’s jolly. I always wanted to see one of
        those big droves on the foot. Shall we wait for them to pass?”</p>
      <p>“I think not,” said the Hon. Justin. “Not until we get to the next
        ranch. They say that those wild range cattle do singular things.” But
        still they stood and watched, fascinated by the shimmering, shifting,
        red cloud, the distant rumble, the glint of a blazing sun on the sabred
        heads of a thousand Texas long-horns.</p>
      <p>Of a sudden the dust-cloud, which had spilled over the road only to the
        right, away from the ranch fence, widened out, shifted to the left. They
        had passed the fence corner, and were on open range. No dust arose on
        that wing; it was hard prairie, tied close by sagebrush. And
        inexperienced as were their eyes, the two Englishmen could see some
        commotion running through the mass; the units composing it were
        spreading hither and thither; two compound dots, mounted men, were
        swinging wide about them. The rumble grew louder, lulled, rose again,
        and above the noise came the sound of a dozen shots, fired in quick
        succession. Away back in his consciousness, Dudley began to regret that
        they had chosen, in their young British insolence, to travel without a
        guide, who might explain to them the strange happenings of this
        incomprehensible country.</p>
      <p>Justin started at the sound of a frightened snort in his ear. He turned
        to see his horses quivering in every nerve. Almost before he could catch
        its bridle, the near one was plunging and pitching.</p>
      <p>“Get the reins!” yelled Justin; “we’d best be out of here.”</p>
      <p>The team broke into a dead run. Looking back, Justin saw the cloud
        ominously, frightfully near. A struggling advance-guard of long-horns
        heaved out before, and ahead of them were two men, riding like demons,
        yet ever beating backward as they rode. Then the red veil fell, and
        there was nothing but a dust-cloud, rolling on nearer and nearer.</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>When the Englishmen were gone, Belle looked after their retreating
        wagon, and sighed. She was just realizing, now that the week was past
        and these clean, courteous, easy-moving beings of another world were
        gone, that she had been dreaming dreams. Emilio looked also, sometimes
        after the wagon, sometimes after the girl. When he bent his gaze on
        Belle he was serious enough, but when his eye ran down the track of
        bloody dots, he drew his lips back from his white teeth, and smiled. He
        was holding the reins of his roan bronco; he dropped them to lean over
        the fence, and looked up the road, away from the wagon.</p>
      <p>“What is it that you see up there?” she asked, carelessly, in Spanish.
      </p>
      <p>“Something that your white-haired friend will be glad to see,” he
        answered. She looked, saw the dust-cloud coming, saw the little, caking
        pool of blood, and went white in a moment.</p>
      <p>“That,” she cried, “that is what your antelope meant! You knew that
        cattle were coming this way to-day.”</p>
      <p>“A thousand head passing up to the White River country. And wild, very
        wild.”</p>
      <p>“They will trample them; kill them!”</p>
      <p>“You thought about that when you kissed him,” he sneered; “the blood
        goes straight, and the wind is right. He will have a run for
        it&#8212;your lover.”</p>
      <p>Then the roar of padding feet was louder, and the herd was coming. They
        were fifty yards away&#8212;and a great, white steer, horned in
        splendor, lowered his muzzle, and bellowed, and tore the earth, and shot
        out in advance. Another followed, and still another, each breaking into
        that rocking run, each one stretching out his nostrils to taste the
        polluted air. They plunged together over the little pool of blood; they
        rolled over and over, horns tossing, feet stamping, throats acclaim. The
        leaders crowded against the corral until its foot-wide posts bent and
        cracked. A deafening roar, the bellow of a thousand mad cattle, and then
        nothing but a tangled riot, speeding on down the scent, a thousand
        great, horned hounds after their quarry.</p>
      <p>It was the blood stampede that makes half-wild cattle wholly demons. A
        clap of lightning, a sudden shot, even the appearance of a dismounted
        man, will send the mercurial herd rushing in panic fear; but let them
        once scent blood, and all hell is loosed in them. No pack of wolves
        follows with the relentless fury of range cattle on the trail of blood.
        Huddled by the barn, still showing his teeth, but half in fright, at the
        box of demons that he had opened, the man who laid the trail knew all
        this. And the girl knew it best of all. </p>
      <p>She was between him and his horse as she turned on him.</p>
      <p>“You did this&#8212;you murderer!”</p>
      <p>“I will go,” he said; “I will cut it loose&#8212;it will stop the
        cattle.” </p>
      <p>“Yes&#8212;<i>you</i>! I will go myself.” He jumped at her as she
        sprang into his saddle. She saw the movement. His lariat hung at the
        saddle-horn. She brought it down on his wrist. The same movement started
        the high-strung little roan, already a-quiver with fear. His heels
        clattered against the bars; Belle, astride like a man, her calico skirts
        tucked about her hips, was riding after the red cloud, swinging wide
        into the sage-brush to pass them.</p>
      <p>The roan had a dash of the thoroughbred. He was the swiftest thing
        coursing that day in the four-cornered race between cattle, cowboys,
        hunted team, and woman, yet he had two hundred yards the worst of his
        start. But, like a thoroughbred, he caught the bit and shook out his
        dapple mane, and laid his belly to the earth as he skimmed. Over
        sage-brush, over treacherous ant-hills, tangling gopher-holes he sped,
        the reins loose, for he knew his work. Two cowboys, caught in the press,
        fighting, swearing, striking brutally at heads and horns as they were
        borne on, called to her in warning; but the roan rounded the pack, shook
        himself free, and galloped on.</p>
      <p>And then Belle saw what she had feared. Knowing their peril, but
        ignorant of the cause, the two Englishmen were hurrying on ahead, with
        the carcass still bumping from the tail-board. The cattle in the road,
        where the running was freer, had gained upon those on the flanks. They
        were going in a wedge, with the speed of an express train. The cows,
        fleeter and fiercer than the males, were leading on. Half a dozen
        cowboys skirmished before, shooting and lashing out desperately, trying
        to back-fire by a counter-panic, taking chances of life with every
        gopher-hole. But there was no checking that mass; when a steer flinched
        before the heavy whip, he was pushed on from behind. And ever they
        bellowed, with a note of tigers in their voices.</p>
      <p>A moment Belle ran before the herd; then calling to the roan, who
        understood as only a cow-horse can understand, she cut an oblique course
        across the herd’s face. She gained the road; the herd was behind her,
        and the roan, gathering his nerve for a final spurt, made for the wagon.
        She shouted, but the roar behind drowned her voice, and so she reached
        for the holster, where Emilio kept his knife. As she whipped it out and
        drew even, reaching for the carcass, the wagon slackened and stopped.
        Her own horse swerved in his course, and shot past before she could
        check him.</p>
      <p>The off-horse, what with fear and exhaustion, had stumbled and fallen
        dead. And the wedge was coming on, now but a quarter of a mile away.</p>
      <p>Deadly as was their fear, the two Englishmen, who had jumped to the
        ground, stood and stared to see her turn in beside the standing horse
        and, without any ceremony, cut his traces and reins. He reared and
        plunged; Justin caught his bridle. </p>
      <p>“Mount quick!” she shouted. And before he could grasp the situation she
        had pushed Dudley to her roan, almost thrown him into the saddle, and
        mounted behind.</p>
      <p>As the snorting horses bounded away, the roar was almost on their
        flanks. It rose to its climax in a great, dull crash. Looking back, the
        girl saw that they were no longer followed. The dust-cloud was a
        whirlpool that rolled and tumbled over the spot where the wagon had
        been. For only a minute; the cowboys closed in, and the panic was over.
        Slowly the men beat back the sullen, sated demons. And when the press
        split there was no wagon at all&#8212;only broken wheels and scattered
        bits of woodwork, and flattened belongings and blood&#8212;blood and
        gleaming gray hairs trampled into everything. </p>
      <p>The two men dismounted and turned to the girl. Then was she first aware
        of her skirts tucked about her hips, and of the manner in which she had
        ridden. Her color rose, and she jumped down. She turned redder a moment
        later when Dudley Latimer took her in his arms and, for the second time
        that morning, kissed her.</p>
      <p>And that time he kissed her in deadly earnest.</p>

      <p>Harrison and his wife were evidently tenderfeet. Worse than that, they
        had never been outside the City of New York before; and why an
        inexperienced, city-bred young man like Harrison should have attempted
        to move a year’s outfit, which weighs a ton, over the Chilkoot Pass, and
        tempt Fate in the bleakness of the Yukon country, no one knew.</p>
      <p>The reason really was Harrison’s wife. Tired of a living salary in the
        city, she was ready, when news of the Klondike gold-fields reached the
        world in 1897, to catch the gold fever; caught it, and argued Harrison
        into resigning his clerkship in an insurance company, and into taking
        her with him to Alaska. They were very much in love, and could not be
        separated. So they invested their savings in sacks of flour, and
        blankets, and tins of coffee, and in tickets to Dyea.</p>
      <p>They landed there in December. This, of course, was an idiotic time to
        arrive, but they didn’t know, and there were lots of other idiots just
        then. When Harrison grasped the fact that he must, himself, pull all his
        pile of provisions over the desolate mountain range that ran upward in
        front of him, his heart failed him; as the Yukoners say, he got cold
        feet. But his wife cheered him. Mrs. Harrison was young, and, therefore,
        hopeful. Moreover, she was a pretty little woman, with a great mass of
        flaxen hair, and on her account many a rough packer on the trail gave
        Harrison a lift with his load in the steeper places.</p>
      <p>They struggled on together through storms and snowdrifts. Little by
        little the outfit neared the summit that had lain eighteen miles from
        them when first they landed. Every morning Harrison would load some two
        hundred and fifty pounds on the sled, pull it up the trail seven miles
        or so, and come back in the afternoon. And the girl, for she was nothing
        more, would cook their little meals on the sheet-iron stove, and dry
        Harrison’s moccasins and coddle him, and tell him how like it all was to
        a picnic, and how she enjoyed the life. Which was not true.</p>
      <p>And so they passed through Canyon City, beyond which there is no God,
        the packers say, and up to Sheep Camp, which is far up in the mountains
        on the timber line, and beyond which there lies a frozen desolation that
        supports no living thing&#8212;not even the scrubby spruce that can
        exist on the bare rock in lower altitudes. Here they disappeared from
        view, because the horses do not go past Sheep Camp, the trail being too
        rough; and the packers, not seeing them, could bring no word.</p>
      <p>Now, there were hotels of a fashion in Dyea at this time, but the
        entire downstairs part was usually made into one room, and used as a
        bar, dance-hall, and gambling house. So when Harrison came back down the
        trail two weeks later at three o’clock in the morning, he had to elbow
        his way up to the bar in the Comique to ask for a room. The first
        bartender looked at him inquiringly, for he had seen the Harrisons on
        the trail, and the teamsters had said they must be over the summit by
        now. His curiosity got the better of him.</p>
      <p>“Are you the party that went up with a little blonde lady three weeks
        ago?” he asked.</p>
      <p>“I may be,” said Harrison.</p>
      <p>“She seemed kind of light for this country,” pursued the bartender.
        “Hope she’s standing it all right. Did she come down with you?”</p>
      <p>“I brought her with me,” said Harrison.</p>
      <p>“Isn’t she coming in? She doesn’t have to pass through the saloon here
        if she don’t like. She can&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>Harrison’s hand went to his forehead. “She’s dead,” he said.</p>
      <p>A teamster came in the side door and spoke to him, and he followed the
        man out. So did two of the dance-hall girls and the first bartender.
        Outside in one of the big freighting sleds lay Mrs. Harrison. Her flaxen
        hair waved as in life over the girlish face, hard now as marble and
        colder. The moon shone full upon her, and a snow crystal hung here and
        there on the little fur parkee that she wore. She might have been a
        marble Madonna there in the moonlight. Through the open door came the
        noise of the next waltz. One of the girls slipped in, and the orchestra
        stopped. Quickly a little group began to gather, but Harrison did not
        move. He seemed as in a trance, staring open-eyed, mistily, at the
        frozen woman in the sled. </p>
      <p>Presently, Blanche, the girl who had stopped the music, touched him on
        the arm.</p>
      <p>“I know there is nothing much I can do for you,” she said. “I know how
        it feels; but I thought perhaps you’d like to bring her inside, and you
        can have my room till you&#8212;till the funeral.”</p>
      <p>And Harrison thanked her. But next day he moved the body to an empty
        cabin that stood on the river bank in the pine grove back of the
        Comique. He could not bury her, he could not give her up, he said. True,
        she could not speak to him, nor move, but even to have her body with him
        was something, a kind of comfort. The bitter cold of the Northland, the
        icy winds that roared in untrammeled fury down the cañon&#8212;these had
        killed her; now they would preserve the beauty they had stilled; keep
        her forever young, as he had known and loved her. Why should he bury
        her? And when they spoke to him of burial, he bade them leave him alone.
      </p>
      <p>Only in the afternoons, when there was no dancing in the Comique,
        Blanche used still to go daily to the cabin in the pines, and brought
        him a padlock for the door, and a lantern, and other things. </p>
      <p>It all might have drifted on in such wise indefinitely, had it not been
        that in a month Harrison had no money to buy his meals with, and that
        Blanche asked him point blank about it.</p>
      <p>“Why don’t you come over and ask Coughlin for something to do?” she
        said, when Harrison admitted that he had eaten no dinner that day.
        Coughlin was the man who ran the Comique.</p>
      <p>“What could I do?” inquired Harrison. “I’m only a bookkeeper.”</p>
      <p>But that night he asked Coughlin about it. Now twice a day Coughlin put
        all the gold and bank-notes that were in the cash drawer into his
        pocket, leaving the silver for change; and he kept his accounts, which
        were few, in his head; and he didn’t need a bookkeeper. But he was sorry
        for Harrison; and, besides, Blanche had spoken to him of it, and he
        wanted to oblige her. For Blanche was popular among the men, and was
        asked to drink oftener than any girl in the house, and was valuable on
        that account in a country where one gets a dollar for two drinks. So he
        told Harrison he could go to work. </p>
      <p>“In the morning?” said Harrison.</p>
      <p>“Any time,” said Coughlin.</p>
      <p>Harrison looked around a moment. “If you’ll show me the books, I think
        I might look them over now.”</p>
      <p>“Books?” said Coughlin, hesitatingly. “There aint any, but I guess you
        can figure all right in this, perhaps.” He produced a small
        paper-covered blank book from under the bottle rack. “You’ll find a lead
        pencil in the drawer any time”; and he bustled over to the faro-bank,
        satisfied that he had demonstrated his familiarity with the bookkeeping
        craft. He came back to ask Harrison what wages he was going to work for.
      </p>
      <p>“Anything,” said Harrison. “In New York I got seventy-five dollars a
        month.”</p>
      <p>“That aint much,” said Coughlin. “I never asked any man to take less
        than three dollars a day and board. You can eat in the restaurant
        there.” Then he introduced Harrison to Big Joe, the day bartender,
        telling Joe this was the bookkeeper. </p>
      <p>An hour later Joe called Harrison to announce that Red Sheehan had got
        a drink without paying therefor.</p>
      <p>“He never will pay for it, either,” continued the experienced Joe, “but
        I suppose you’ll put it down in the bookkeeping.”</p>
      <p>Harrison seemed a little undecided as to the value of this entry, and
        his uncertainty settled it, for thereafter Joe never mentioned such
        items, and as for Coughlin, he continued to dump the uncounted contents
        of the cash drawer at various times into his pocket, and to pay his
        debts out of the same receptacle with a total disregard to cash
        balances, daily receipts, or outstanding accounts, which made Harrison’s
        methodical hair stand on end. </p>
      <p>Occasionally, however, he would ask Harrison how he was getting along,
        and Harrison, who had debited Red Sheehan’s account with one drink, and
        who had never had occasion to make a second entry of any kind, generally
        replied that the work was pretty light.</p>
      <p>“That’s all right,” Coughlin would say. “Bookkeepers are mighty handy
        to have around in case you want to figure some time.”</p>
      <p>And so Harrison drew his three dollars a day, and ate in the
        restaurant, where Blanche usually managed to sit opposite. Then in the
        evening he sat idle in the Comique, and watched the roulette wheels spin
        and the cards drop monotonously from the faro-box, heard the metallic
        call of the dealers and the buzz of the ball in the runaway of the
        wheel; saw the dancing-girls, in all the glories of scarlet satin,
        promiscuous affection, and peroxide hair, waltz past; listened to the
        wandering musicians of the orchestra play some good music and much bad;
        sat in a chair near the end of the bar, and watched the carnival of sin
        and revelry around him, and then, about midnight, when he felt entitled
        to leave, he went back to the lonely cabin, where his wife lay in her
        changeless sleep, to sit and keep his vigil with her he had loved in
        life and still adored in death. </p>
      <p>In the restaurant he had many conversations with Blanche. “How long
        will you stay here?” she asked him once.</p>
      <p>“Always, I suppose,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But this is only a boom town,” she answered. “Next year there will be
        no one here but the Siwashes, and they will be quarreling among
        themselves for these buildings.”</p>
      <p>“I’ll stay,” persisted Harrison.</p>
      <p>“But how can you live? Coughlin is going down the river this summer,
        and a man must eat. Why don’t you come along with the rest of us? He’ll
        take everybody that is working here, for he means to open up again in
        the Yukon country.” Harrison shook his head.</p>
      <p>To Blanche he was interesting. Even in the depths to which she had
        fallen, or rather deliberately descended, there exists an unconfessed
        desire for the better things of the past, for the moral levels which
        have been derided and deserted, for the things which are bitter with the
        sourness of the grapes the fox could not attain to; and to talk with
        Harrison was a breath from the old world, monotonous, perhaps, but
        lovable, where she, too ... but she never thought of those things. What
        was the use? It made her sad, and she would undoubtedly drink more than
        usual, and get reckless, and buy wine with her salary and percentage
        money, and be in debt to the house for a month afterward. So she didn’t
        think much. It didn’t ever occur to her that her interest in Harrison
        was passing the danger line. It wouldn’t have made any difference
        anyway.</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>A month later, Coughlin announced that the Comique would have a grand
        closing one week from that night. “The money is about through in this
        town,” he said, in explanation. “We’ll move on to the gold mines.”</p>
      <p>Blanche discussed it that evening with Harrison in the restaurant The
        news disturbed him.</p>
      <p>“You’ll come, too?” she said. He didn’t know. “There’ll be nothing
        here,” she went on, “and it will be so lonely.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t mind the loneliness,” said Harrison.</p>
      <p>“But I’ll be lonely.”</p>
      <p>“Perhaps Coughlin wouldn’t want me, anyway. I haven’t done a stroke of
        work while I’ve been here.”</p>
      <p>“But he’ll want you if I say so. I’m the best girl he’s got,” said
        Blanche, modestly, “and if I say so it goes. And I do say so.”</p>
      <p>Harrison was silent. He had often thought of this. He had known, of
        course, that he could not live forever at the Comique. Many times he had
        decided that death were easier than a final parting from the dead. He
        had thought that he could never leave her, but
        now&#8212;&#8212;&#160;Well, the lust of life is strong. We do not know
        how far the fall is until we stand at the brink and look over. Besides
        there is no coming back. If we could only try it for a while and return
        again!</p>
      <p>“Harrison,” said Blanche, suddenly, “listen. I think I know what you
        are thinking, and I know I can not argue such a thing with you. No one
        could. You know best, and no one else can know anything about it. But I
        want to tell you one fact that perhaps you haven’t thought of. You want
        to stay here with her&#8212;always. But you can’t. I know it is horrible
        to talk of, but it is not always winter even in Alaska, and the summer
        is almost here.” The man winced. “Go to bed, Harrison,” she said; “I can
        not talk of such things. You know best.” </p>
      <p>He went away to the cabin. He knew that Blanche was right. It must
        be&#8212;but the anguish of it. How should he say the last farewell?
      </p>
      <p>At the foot of the mountains that stretch upward from the Dyea sands,
        he dug a grave, four feet. And that night he would bury her. But his
        resolution failed him. All night he sat beside the unreplying dead and
        stroked her icy hands. “To-morrow I will do it,” he said. But the next
        day he dug again in the grave. It should be six feet. And neither could
        he say farewell that night.</p>
      <p>Then Blanche came over to him. “We leave on Saturday. You know to-day
        is Wednesday,” she said, and went away quickly, for she saw the sheeted
        form, and understood something of his pain. On Thursday she came again.
        Harrison had not been at the restaurant all day, and she carried a tray
        with her. The cabin was empty, but a note on the table said: “I can not
        give her up. I could not hide her in a grave of earth. I will lay her on
        the mountain top above the glacier. Thank you. Good-by.”</p>
      <p>Now the glacier lies in a greater crater of the mountains there, above
        the snow line, five thousand feet above Dyea; and behind it there towers
        a solitary peak that juts needle-like, head and shoulders over the
        lesser crags of the crater. Up above the world, far from the sound of
        man, into the great silence it reaches, where only the northern lights
        keep the long vigils with its wind-tormented top.</p>
      <p>That night when Blanche asked Billy Matthews, who ought to know, being
        a squaw-man and an old-timer there, how long it would take to go to the
        glacier, he said the Siwashes called it two days. “And how long would it
        take to go to the top of the big peak?” Matthews smiled. “Why, no one’s
        ever gone, sis, and I don’t scarcely think they will.”</p>
      <p>But the next day Blanche borrowed the glasses from the trading-post and
        watched the snow line. About four o’clock a black speck gradually
        emerged at the timber limit, and showed sharply against the snow-fields
        that lay beyond. The glasses showed a man with a long bundle upon his
        back. Blanche closed them, and watched the speck with her naked eye.
        Slowly it crept to the foot of the great ice rampart, and as it mounted
        the green precipices, a bank of cloud engulfed it.</p>
      <p>Early next morning Blanche searched the mountain with the glasses. The
        speck had crossed the miles of glacier in the night, and was half way up
        the mighty pinnacle that lay behind. There it clung to a precarious hold
        on the storm-swept crag, its ghastly burden still upon its shoulders.
        Five hundred feet below it lay a great snow-field, hundreds of feet
        deep. Five hundred feet above it hung the mountain crest. Blanche could
        see the wind sweep great banks of snow around the speck. The footing
        must have been slippery, for the speck climbed less than a hundred feet
        in an hour, and then, as a wind-gust swept a swirling eddy of sleet
        across the precipice, it fell&#8212;fell straight to the eternal snows
        five hundred feet beneath it, and disappeared. Even with the glasses
        Blanche could see no hole in the drift, and besides the wind would fill
        it full again almost at once.</p>
      <p>Gray-lipped, she sought out Matthews. “Billy,” she asked him, “how far
        would a man sink in that snow up there if he fell off the top of the
        peak?” </p>
      <p>“My God, what questions,” said Billy. “How do I know? He’d stay a
        thousand years, anyway.”</p>

        title='The Jewels of Bendita'>THE JEWELS OF BENDITA</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Gibert Cunyngham Terry</div>
      <p>Old Bendito was digging when he found them&#8212;“the jewels of
        Bendita.” He had been ordered by Don Francisco to make a new border
        around the “Little Lake of the Emperor” (as it is called even to these
        days), and, grumbling mightily, the old man set lazily to work. Stopping
        only occasionally to refresh himself with a corn-husk cigarette, Bendito
        dug away for as much as two hours, when he was joined by his comrade,
        Andrés, who proceeded to pass the time of day.</p>
      <p>“What makest thou, friend? Wherefore dost toil so strenuously with no
        friend to assist thee, and in the heat of the day?”</p>
      <p>“Oh, lazybones! According to that fool, Don Francisco&#8212;may the
        devil fly away with him&#8212;I am making a new bordering for the little
        lake. For why? Only God knows. But these strangers&#8212;<i>la
          Virgen</i> bear witness that&#8212;lacking other work, they make a
        hole in the ground, in order that a poor devil may have to straightway
        fill it up again!”</p>
      <p>Overwhelmed by his own eloquence, old Bendito groaned, emitted a fiery
        Indian oath, and set to spading. “To that mango tree, and no further, I
        will dig today!” he muttered. “To the devil with Don Francisco.”</p>
      <p>Andrés, sprawling in the sunshine, offered sarcastic comments and
        encouragements. “Have a care, comrade. Knowest thou not that there is
        wealth concealed in this same garden of the emperor? Oh, yes! I
        overheard Padre Diego say so to the Obispo. Be careful lest thou dig it
        up, little brother.” </p>
      <p>In cynical disbelief, Bendito dug away. “Thinkest thou that if riches
        were here, Padre Diego and the Obispo would leave them untouched?
        Nonsense. They-of-the-church never allow the paring of a nail to remain,
        much less treasure. Compose thyself, little Andrés. <i>Once</i> there
        may have been buried treasure of the emperor. But the nose of the church
        is sharp, and it smells gold while yet far off.” </p>
      <p>At this juncture, Bendito’s spade interrupted conversation with a loud
        and startling “clink, clank,” and crossing themselves, their faces gray
        with superstitious terror, both <i>peons</i> fled with all haste from
        the spot. Their first thought was that a coffin had been uncovered, and
        only witches and unblessed heretics would be buried here in this
        unhallowed ground. But, as they ran, another idea occurred to them. They
        stopped abruptly, and low talk ensued. Then they stole cautiously back
        to the mango tree, where the spade still stood upright. And while old
        Bendito dug away, in fear and trembling, but with more energy than he
        had displayed since the big earthquake (wherein part of his roof came
        down upon his head), Andrés watched to see that no one caught them. Who
        knew what might be uncovered? It was well to be cautious.</p>
      <p>Firmly embedded in the earth, the men found a large wooden box. Rotting
        from damp, with its copper bands oxidized, there still showed intact an
        insignia that caused the Indians to tremble with excitement. And no
        wonder. They had stumbled upon the buried treasure of an emperor.</p>
      <p>They hurried with the wonderful box to a small ruined pavilion at one
        end of the great melancholy garden. No one ever visited this little
        rustic building, which the superstitious vowed was haunted by the
        unhappy emperor. But, forgetful of spirits or other evils, Bendito and
        Andrés pushed back the door, and, in the half gloom, wrenched open the
        rotting box.</p>
      <p>Out upon Bendito’s faded <i>tilma</i>, spread beneath the box, dropped
        things that made even those ignorant Indians gasp in greedy terror. How
        they sparkled and shone&#8212;these ornaments that great queens and
        empresses had worn&#8212;the chains of brilliant white stones, necklaces
        of rubies and emeralds, exquisite ear ornaments, the diamond-studded
        portraits of royalties, and other fabulously valuable things. There were
        not more than a dozen articles in all, and yet worth much money, as
        these men knew. For they had both traveled to the great, rich capital
        city, on the Paseo, where the wealthy dames wore these same sparkling
        stones. The two replaced the jewels, their fingers trembling and eyes
        burning with greed, and begun to discuss the division. And the sun sank
        low while they argued and disagreed.</p>
      <p>Andrés, having no home or family wherewith to bless himself, was not
        missed that night. But old Juana, the wife of Bendito, being of a
        suspicious and jealous temperament, at last pricked forth in search of
        her missing lord. As it was late, there went with her their daughter,
        Bendita, a flat, squat maiden of sixteen. A good girl she was, but as
        homely as could well be.</p>
      <p>Bendito was not to be found in his usual haunts. Neither the
        “Caballitos” nor the “Haven of Peaceful Men” <i>cantine</i> knew him,
        and he was not listening to the music in the plaza. These things being
        so, the baleful eye of his spouse lit up fiercely.</p>
      <p>“The disgraceful old devil,” she muttered to Bendita, “is, without
        doubt, in the great garden, which is sufficiently retired and convenient
        for flirtations. We will find him there, doubtless, with the wife of
        Pepe.”</p>
      <p>And there they found him, very dead, but not with the wife of Pepe!
        Instead, his companion was the equally dead Andrés. They had evidently
        quarreled over the treasure, and then fought with <i>machetes</i>.
        Between the two was the wooden box, with copper bands. It was
        blood-covered, and the women of old Bendito wailed and crossed
        themselves as they looked upon it and the two men who had fought over it
        to the death. They hastily flung Bendito’s blanket over him, and,
        crossing themselves, started to flee.</p>
      <p>Bendita, lingering to caress the old man, again noted the box. “It may
        be that it contains money,” she whispered, and picked it up, though her
        mother protested.</p>
      <p>With <i>rebosos</i> closely drawn, the women scurried homeward, leaving
        the dead men alone where they had fallen. Heartless of them? Well, no,
        for in the tropics law and order sometimes mean little, and these women
        knew well that, if they gave the alarm, they would probably be suspected
        and convicted of the murder.</p>
      <p>Stealthily opened, at midnight, the box proved to contain what old
        Juana and her daughter mistook for mere white, red, and green
        glass&#8212;no gold and no silver! The old woman, in a transport of
        rage, sorrow, and disappointment, spit upon the jewels. “Accursed things
        of mere glass,” she screamed, “to think that my poor Bendito died for
        such valueless things as <i>you</i>.” </p>
      <p>There was great lamentation next morning when old Bendito was found and
        brought home to his alarmed family. They wept and wailed so that people
        were very sorry for them, and Padre Diego volunteered, in the goodness
        of his heart, to say fifty masses, “at a merely nominal price,” for the
        soul of the departed <i>peon</i>. Andrés, no one seemed to regret, and
        no masses were ever said over him, at bargain prices or otherwise. And
        so Andrés and Bendito passed away, by no means the first men to die for
        the sake of greed and riches.</p>
      <p>While the widow and daughter of Bendito considered the “glass jewels”
        of no value, for all the world wore gold and silver trinkets, they were
        nevertheless afraid to speak or even hint of them, lest they be
        suspected of complicity in the murder. Therefore, the box was kept
        hidden in a secret place, and for a while the widow kept her mouth
        closed, though she dearly loved to gossip. But the custody of the box,
        and the consequent secrecy entailed upon her, were entirely too much for
        poor Juana. She sickened and began to pine for her country, as the
        Indians so quaintly call their birthplaces.</p>
      <p>Wherefore, their belongings were disposed of, and the two women
        proceeded to their old home, many leagues distant. With them was carried
        the crumbling box of jewels. Not long after reaching her birthplace,
        Juana proceeded to die. Toward the last, she grew exceedingly nervous
        over the “glass jewels,” speculating much as to their value, and
        declaring that at the worst they might be pawned for a <i>peso</i> or
        two. And, still babbling of them, the old woman died, and was, in
        Biblical fashion, “buried with her fathers.”</p>
      <p>While not of a superstitious disposition, Bendita began to experience
        some of her mother’s qualms about the box and its contents. Finally, for
        its safety, she secretly removed several tiles from the floor of her
        room, and concealed the jewels therein. Then, satisfied that no one
        would find them there, she gave no more thought to the matter, for of
        what avail were the baubles? “One can not eat or drink them,” she mused.
        “But for their sake my poor father died.”</p>
      <p>At this time, Ponciana, the pretty daughter of Pancho, the
        <i>cargador</i>, returned from Mission school to her proud family. After
        her there trailed, later, her sweetheart, Amado. And after Amado, in
        turn, came the deluge. For untoward things began to occur. First was the
        falling in love of poor homely Bendita. This, of course, was all right;
        any woman can fall in love with any man, if she so elects. But ordinary
        decency demands that she at least restrain her passion when the
        betrothed of another woman is concerned. And it was Amado, Ponciana’s
        novio, upon whom Bendita needs must cast eyes. Of course, it was absurd.
        For Bendita was square, fat, and flat (if you can figure to yourself
        such a combination), while Ponciana was exceedingly sweet and pretty.
        Besides, she had been taught in Mission school, knew some English and
        much quaint slang, and was a fascinating little Indian maiden. </p>
      <p>“La Ponciana, she knows <i>much</i>,” had been Amado’s glowing
        description to that potent personage, his mother. “She plays the piano
        and guitar well, and sings, aye, as do the birds! And she dances in a
        manner entirely exquisite&#8212;and sews and embroiders.”</p>
      <p>Despite all this eloquence, however, Amado, after due temptation,
        heartlessly jilted Ponciana for the unattractive and homely Bendita. It
        happened thus: Unable to make any impression on the handsome Amado,
        despite her sighs and eye-rolling, Bendita at length decided to take, as
        it were, a back seat, and merely view from afar her beloved, who nightly
        paraded in the plaza with his beloved. And here it was, one evening,
        that a brilliant thought came to Bendita.</p>
      <p>It was an ideal night, “one borrowed from Paradise,” as the poetical
        Amado had murmured to his Ponciana. Great bright stars blazed in a
        velvety-blue sky, while silvery moonlight cast a radiance over the
        beautiful tropical plaza, wherein fountains trickled musically, and
        glowing flowers of the tropics heavily perfumed the soft, languid air.
        From the remote band-stand came sweet, faint strains of the exquisite
        “Angel de Amor,” while the lowered voices of many gay loungers murmured
        in musical harmony therewith. </p>
      <p>Every one seemed so happy that it was no wonder that tears came to
        Bendita’s eyes, as she sat, alone and neglected, in her solitary corner.
        “I have so much homeliness,” she thought, drearily; “no one will ever
        wish me for a <i>novia</i>&#8212;<i>ay de mi</i>!”</p>
      <p>Again Amado and Ponciana passed by, Ponciana smiling and dimpling. She
        wore a white <i>mantilla</i>, while on her finger there was a genuine
        ring of gold, set with a white stone that sparkled in the moonlight. It
        was the ring of betrothal, that day given. Amado, being poor, had
        secured it cheaply from a pawnshop. But Ponciana did not know.</p>
      <p>As she gayly flitted by, Bendita noted the sparkle of the ring. “It is
        like the little glass jewels,” she pondered. “How Amado seems to like
        it! I might&#8212;I might wear those at home. They sparkle, too.”</p>
      <p>Behold Bendita, therefore, the next night, arrayed even more
        magnificently than Solomon in all his glory. For Solomon, whatever he
        may have gotten himself up in, surely never wore such huge diamond
        ornaments in the ears, such diamonds and rubies in the hair, such
        magnificent bracelets. All this was topped off by a long string of
        diamonds and pearls, while outside her <i>mantilla</i>, at the neck,
        Bendita displayed, in all humility, a necklace of pear-shaped black and
        white pearls.</p>
      <p>Amado, who had served for three years as a pawnbroker’s clerk, alone of
        the crowd in the plaza knew that the girl’s jewels were
        real&#8212;fabulously rich. “<i>Carrambas</i>,” he thought, excitedly;
        “she, in those jewels, is rich as a princess. El Señor Vega, alone,
        would give fifty thousand <i>pesos</i> for them!”</p>
      <p>Others, noting the new finery of the homely girl, said smilingly: “What
        pretty playthings of glass has our good Bendita found?”</p>
      <p>A week’s time saw the feckless Amado off with the old love and on with
        the new. Quick work, it is true, but&#8212;consider the extenuating
        circumstances. To do him justice, he had a plan for securing the jewels
        (with Bendita, if it had to be), and later, making matters up with his
        own pretty first love. Two things prevented this, however: first,
        Bendita rarely wore, touched, or mentioned the jewels, and he was
        fearful of exciting her suspicions; second, the jilted Ponciana had
        vanished from the ken of even her own family. No one seemed to know
        where she was. Old Madre Piedad, in San Geronimo town near by, knew. The
        latter dame, thought to be a witch, was the girl’s near relative. To her
        Ponciana had stated merely that some one had injured her; and asked if
        Madre Maria would keep her quietly hidden, and teach her how to avenge
        herself. Madre Piedad promised, and the two, with the aid of an ugly,
        squat, herb-stuffed doll, a brazero of hot coals, and some long pins,
        set the ball of vengeance in motion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, instead of preparing for marriage, Bendita fell grievously
        ill. She lost flesh rapidly, could not eat, drink, or rest, and
        complained of agonizing pains that shot through her body. A doctor was
        consulted, but could not relieve her. Then various old women congregated
        and muttered together&#8212;they could do nothing! Of a truth, it could
        be nothing less than the <i>mal del ojo</i> (evil eye), and with that
        only old Madre Piedad, of San Geronimo, could cope. Wherefore Madre
        Piedad was sent for, and entreated. </p>
      <p>At dusk she arrived&#8212;a bundled-up old dame, her halting steps
        aided by crutches, and her face shrouded in many <i>tapalos</i>. A large
        bundle came with her&#8212;“medicines,” she gruffly explained. The other
        women, secretly in deadly terror of her, gladly withdrew at her
        commands. “If you wish me to make a cure, you must get out and leave me
        alone with the patient,” she ordered. And not until the premises were
        clear did she begin operations.</p>
      <p>“Arise!” she commanded the suffering Bendita, “arise, and search out
        the glass trinkets which spirits tell me you have hidden away! Place the
        trinkets, <i>all</i> of them, in this earthen bowl of water, and let
        them remain so for eight hours. In the morning drink the water, after
        removing the glass jewels. You will then be entirely cured, I promise
        you.”</p>
      <p>Dazed and sick, poor Bendita arose from her bed and stumbled about,
        obeying the old woman’s mandates. All of the jewels were deposited in an
        earthen bowl, which, half filled with holy water, was placed in the
        exact centre of the room. Then, swallowing a colorless liquid that Madre
        Piedad gave her, Bendita was soon fast asleep. The old witch smiled to
        herself as she listened to the sick girl’s deep, regular breathing.
        “Well may she sleep,” she muttered, who had shamelessly given a nostrum
        that would induce eight hours’ sleep. </p>
      <p>And now the old body set busily to work. First she deftly manufactured,
        out of her mysterious bundle, a dummy figure that exactly resembled her
        own. This she seated prominently before the doorway, so that chance
        visitors seeing it would, in their fear of her, retire without entering.
        Quickly she slipped out of her many <i>tapalos</i> and other disguises,
        and stood forth, straight, young, and lovely&#8212;no less a being than
        the jilted Ponciana! Hastily she removed the jewels from their watery
        resting-place, transferring them to a stout bag, which she tied about
        her waist, under a <i>reboso</i>. The bowl she left in its original
        position, save that into it she cast a small, ragged, rudely made doll,
        into which had been plunged many pins. This done, she was ready for
        flight. “<i>Adios</i>, Bendita,” she chuckled, with a wicked smile on
        her pretty face. “You can have my lover&#8212;for I have your rich
        jewels!” </p>
      <p>Various neighbors came next morning to inquire for the sick girl, but
        were frightened away by the supposed figure of the witch. Bendita
        herself, waking up entirely cured after ten hours’ sleep, first
        discovered the trick, and cast forth the dummy figure, with much wailing
        and gnashing of teeth. But all was not lost, even if the jewels were
        gone for aye. Because, drolly enough, Amado was so sorry for the bereft
        one that he married her, and they have been happy ever after.</p>
      <p>And Ponciana? Did you ever happen to see the exquisite Señora de la
        Villa y Garcia, “of Mexico and Paris,” with her wrinkled old husband,
        and her beautiful toilettes and jewels? Well, <i>that</i> is Ponciana.

        THE MAN-DOG</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Nathan C. Kouns</div>
      <p>My first knowledge of the singular being called “Du Chien, the
        Man-Dog,” began when we were on duty down in the Peché country, a short
        time after General Taylor’s celebrated “Run on the Banks,” in the
        vicinity of Mansfield. The cavalry had really very little to do except
        “to feed,” and await orders. As a result of this idleness many of the
        officers and men formed pleasant acquaintances with the hospitable
        planters in whose neighborhood we were located.</p>
      <p>One of the planters whom I found to be most congenial was Captain
        Martas, a French creole, whose father had come from Languedoc. He was
        himself native-born. He was a man of forty-eight or fifty years of age,
        and had two sons by his first marriage, who were in the army of
        Virginia, and a boy two years of age, by his second wife, who was a
        young and beautiful lady. The housekeeper was a mulatto girl, who was in
        every physical development almost a perfect being&#8212;even her small
        hands looking like consummate wax-work. She had been taught, petted, and
        indulged as much, perhaps, or more than any slave should have been,
        especially by Captain Martas, who uniformly spoke to her more in the
        tone of a father addressing his daughter, than in that of a master
        commanding a slave. She was always gentle and obedient. The family
        seemed to prize her very greatly, and the little boy especially
        preferred her to his own beautiful mother. I suppose it would be hard
        for the later generation, who remember little or nothing of the
        “domestic institution,” to understand how such a pleasant and beautiful
        confidence and friendship could exist between a slave and her owners,
        but it was no uncommon thing in the South before the war.</p>
      <p>The family was so attractive that I visited it often; but one evening,
        on my arrival at the house, I found that its peace and quiet had been
        disturbed by one of those painful occurrences which so often marred the
        happiness of Southern families, and which really constituted the curse
        of “the peculiar institution.”</p>
      <p>The day before, the beautiful and accomplished wife of Captain Martas
        had, for some unexplained reason, got into a frenzy of rage with Celia,
        the mulattress, and had ordered the overseer to give her a severe
        whipping. The girl had run off into the Black Swamp during the night,
        and Captain Martas, who imparted this information to me, was in a state
        of terrible distress by reason of her absence. He did not seem to
        understand the cause of the trouble, but he could not justify his slave
        without condemning his wife, whom he seemed to regard with a most tender
        and dutiful devotion. The only emotion which seemed to master him was a
        heart-breaking and hopeless grief. I volunteered to hunt for the
        runaway, and while asking for such information as I thought to be
        necessary about the neighboring plantations, and of the almost boundless
        and impracticable wilderness known as the Black Swamp, I saw Celia
        slowly and quietly coming up the broad walk which led from the portico
        to the big gate. </p>
      <p>She carried in her hand a branch of the magnolia tree, from which
        depended a splendid blossom of that most glorious of all flowers. She
        bowed slightly as she came near the portico, and, passing around the
        corner of the house, entered it by a side door. Mrs. Martas was most
        passionately devoted to the magnolia, and, from her exclamations of
        delight, which were soon heard in the hall, we knew that Celia had
        brought the beautiful flower as a peace-offering to her mistress, and
        that it had been accepted as such. Very soon the two women came nearer,
        and from our seats on the veranda we could hear their conversation. A
        terrible weight seemed to have been lifted from the heart of Captain
        Martas by the girl’s return, and by the apparent renewal of friendly
        relations between his beautiful wife and his even more beautiful
        slave&#8212;a relief which showed itself in his face and form, but not
        in his speech.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” said Celia to Mrs. Martas, “it is an old, wide-spreading tree on
        the very edge of the water, and is glorious with just such splendid
        blossoms as these. There must be more than three hundred clusters, some
        that I could not reach being much larger and finer than this one.”</p>
      <p>“And you say,” answered Mrs. Martas, “that the air is still, and that
        the perfume broods all around the tree? Oh, how sweet!”</p>
      <p>“Yes,” said Celia, “it is so strong that you can taste as well as smell
        the wonderful perfume. Few people could bear to stand immediately
        beneath the shade; it is so sweet as to be almost overpowering.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, how I wish I could see it! How far is it, Celia?”</p>
      <p>“Only four miles. You can go. It is deep in the swamp: but the pony can
        follow the ridge all the way. You can go, and get home before dusk. I
        would like you to see it before a rain makes the road too bad, or the
        winds come and scatter the delicious perfume that now hangs as heavy as
        dew all around the glorious tree for yards and yards away.”</p>
      <p>“I will go,” she cried. “Tell Toby to bring out Selim, and you can take
        a horse. Let us go at once. It is getting late.”</p>
      <p>“I would rather walk,” said Celia, “so as to be sure that I will not
        miss the route in going back, although I watched so carefully that I
        know I can find it on foot.”</p>
      <p>Very soon a boy led up Mrs. Martas’s pony, and she went out to the
        steps and mounted, followed by Celia on foot. The girl held the stirrup
        for her mistress, and as she did so looked back at Captain Martas with
        eyes in which shone strange love, pity, and tenderness; but the voice of
        her mistress called her away, and, even in turning her black and
        lustrous eyes toward Captain Martas, their expression totally changed,
        and showed for a fleeting instant the murderous glitter that gleamed
        from the eyes of a panther when ready for a fatal spring.</p>
      <p>I was startled and troubled, and half moved forward to tell the lady
        not to go; but a moment’s reflection showed me how foolish such an
        unnecessary and silly interference would seem. A strange mistrust
        flitted across my mind, but there was nothing on which to base it. I
        could not give a reason for it, except to say that I had seen the light
        of a gladiator’s eye, the twitch and spasm of an assassin’s lip, in the
        eye and mouth of that now smiling and dutiful young slave girl. The
        thing was too foolish to think of, and I held my peace.</p>
      <p>The women passed out of the gate, and went on quietly in the direction
        of the Black Swamp. Martas and I resumed our conversation. Hour after
        hour passed away, and the sun grew large and low in the West; still Mrs.
        Martas did not return. The sun was setting&#8212;set; but she had not
        come. Then Captain Martas called Toby and had him ride to the edge of
        the wood and see if he could learn anything of his mistress; but Toby
        soon came back, saying that he saw nothing except the pony’s tracks
        leading into the swamp, and the pony himself leisurely coming home
        without a rider. Then Captain Martas mounted, and I followed him. He
        took the plantation conch-shell, and we rode on into the dark forest as
        long as we could trace any footsteps of the pony, or find any open way,
        and again and again Captain Martas blew resonant blasts upon his shell
        that rolled far away over the swamp, seeking to apprise his wife that we
        were there, and waiting for her; but nothing came of it.</p>
      <p>“They could hear the shell,” he said, “upon a still night like this
        three or four miles,” and it seemed to him impossible that they could
        have gone beyond the reach of the sound. But no answer came, and the
        moonless night came down over the great Black Swamp, and the darkness
        grew almost visible, so thoroughly did it shut off all vision like a
        vast black wall.</p>
      <p>Then Martas sent Toby back to the plantation for fire and blankets, and
        more men, and soon a roaring blaze mounted skyward, and every few
        minutes the conch-shell was blown. Nothing more could be done. I
        remained with the now sorely troubled husband through the night. At the
        first peep of dawn he had breakfast brought from the plantation, and as
        soon as it became light enough to see in the great forest, we searched
        for and found the pony’s track, and we carefully followed the traces
        left in the soft soil. The chase led, with marvelous turns and twists,
        right along the little ridge of firmer land which led irregularly on
        between the boundless morasses stretched on either side, trending now
        this way, now that, but always penetrating deeper and deeper into the
        almost unknown bosom of the swamp. The pony had followed his own trail
        in coming out of the swamp, and this made it easier for us to trace his
        way. At last we came to the dark, sluggish, sullen water. It was a point
        of solid ground, of less than an acre in extent, a foot or two above the
        water, almost circular in outline, and nearly surrounded by the lagoon.
        It was comparatively clear of timber, and near the centre rose a grand
        magnolia tree, such as Celia had described to Mrs. Martas on the evening
        before. At the root of this tree, bathed with the rich, overpowering
        perfume of the wonderful bloom above her, lay the dead body of the
        beautiful woman, her clothes disordered, her hair disheveled, a coarse,
        dirty handkerchief stuffed into her mouth, and all the surroundings
        giving evidence of a despairing struggle and a desperate crime. Captain
        Martas was overcome with anguish, and after one agonized look around, as
        if to assure himself that Celia was not also somewhere in sight, he sat
        down beside the body and gazed upon his murdered wife in silent,
        helpless agony of spirit.</p>
      <p>I desired all the men to remain where they were, except Toby, whom I
        ordered to follow me; and then, beginning at the little ridge of land
        between the waters by which we had reached the circular space before
        described, we followed the edge of the ground completely round to the
        starting point, seeking in the soft mud along the shore for a footprint,
        or the mark made by a canoe or skiff, for some evidence of the route by
        which the murderer had reached the little peninsula, or by which Celia
        had left it.</p>
      <p>We found perfect tracks of all animal life existing in the swamps, even
        to the minute lines left by the feet of the smallest birds, but no trace
        of a human foot, although a snail could not have passed into or out of
        the water without leaving his mark upon the yielding mud, much less a
        footstep or a canoe.</p>
      <p>The thing was inexplicable. Where was Celia? How had she gone without
        leaving a trace of her departure? Had she been there at all? Who had
        murdered Mrs. Martas? Surely some man or devil had perpetrated that
        crime. How had the villain escaped from the scene of his crime, leaving
        not the slightest clew by which it was possible to tell which way he had
        gone?</p>
      <p>I reported to Captain Martas the exact condition of the affair, and
        told him I knew not what to do, unless we could get bloodhounds and put
        them on the trail. He said there were no hounds within sixty miles; that
        all of the planters he knew preferred to lose a runaway rather than to
        follow them with the dogs. Rumors of the loss of Mrs. Martas had spread
        from plantation to camp, and two or three soldiers had immediately
        ridden out to the plantation, and then had followed us to the scene of
        the crime. One of them said: “If there are no hounds, send to camp for
        old Du Chien. He is better than any dog.” </p>
      <p>The remark was so singular that I asked: “What do you mean by saying
        ‘He is better than any dog’?”</p>
      <p>“I mean that he can follow the trail by the scent better than any hound
        I ever saw, and I have seen hundreds of them.”</p>
      <p>“Is that a mere camp story,” said I, “or do you know it of your own
        knowledge?”</p>
      <p>“I know it myself, sir,” said the soldier. “I have seen him smell a man
        or his clothes, and then go blindfold into a whole regiment and pick out
        that man by his scent. I have seen him pull a lock of wool off a sheep,
        smell it good, and then go blindfold into the pen and pick out that
        identical sheep from fifty others. I have known him to smell the blanket
        a nigger slept in, and follow that darky four or five miles by the scent
        of him through cotton, corn, and woods. He is better than a dog.”</p>
      <p>The man looked to be honest and intelligent; and while I could hardly
        credit such an astounding and abnormal development of the nasal power in
        a human being, there was nothing else to do; so I told him to take my
        horse and his own, ride as quickly as possible to camp, and bring old Du
        Chien with him.</p>
      <p>Then we made a litter, and slowly and reverently we bore the corpse of
        the murdered lady along the difficult road until we reached a point to
        which it was possible to bring a carriage, in which we placed her in
        charge of the horrified neighbors, who had by this time collected at the
        plantation.</p>
      <p>Captain Martas insisted on remaining with me and awaiting the coming of
        Du Chien.</p>
      <p>More than two hours elapsed before the soldier whom I had sent for Du
        Chien, the Man-Dog, returned with that strange creature. He surely
        deserved his name. He must have been six feet high, but was so lank,
        loose, flabby, and jumbled-up that it was hard to even guess at his
        stature. His legs were long and lank, and his hands hung down to his
        knees. A bristly shock of red hair grew nearly down to his eyebrows, and
        his head slanted back to a point, sugar-loaf fashion. His chin seemed to
        have slid back into his lank, flabby neck, and his face looked as if it
        stopped at the round, red, slobbering mouth. His nose was not remarkably
        large, but the sloping away of all the facial lines from it, as from a
        central point, gave his nasal organ an expression of peculiar prominence
        and significance. When he walked, every bone and muscle about him
        drooped forward, as if he were about to fall face foremost and travel
        with his hands and feet.</p>
      <p>Briefly I explained what had happened, and thereupon Du Chien, who
        seemed to be a man of few words, said: “Stay where you are, all of you,
        for a minute.” Then he started off at his singular dog-trot pace, and
        followed the edge of the water all the way around, just as I had done,
        lightly, but with wonderful celerity. Then he came back to us, looking
        much puzzled. I handed him the coarse, dirty handkerchief which I had
        taken from the dead woman’s mouth, and Du Chien immediately buried that
        wonderful nose of his in it, and snuffed at it long and vigorously.
        Having apparently satisfied himself, he removed the dirty rag from his
        face and said: “Nigger.” </p>
      <p>“No,” said I, thinking of Celia, and looking Du Chien in his little,
        round, deep-set eyes; “a mulatto.”</p>
      <p>“No,” he answered, with quiet assurance; “not mulatto; nigger; black,
        wool-headed, and old&#8212;a buck nigger.”</p>
      <p>“What can you do?” said I.</p>
      <p>“Wait a minute,” said Du Chien. Then he started off again to make the
        circuit of the peninsula, but more slowly and deliberately than at
        first. He threw his head from side to side, like a hound, and smelled at
        every tree and shrub. He had got about half way around when he reached a
        mighty tree that grew on the edge of the swamp, leaning out over the
        water where it was narrowest and deepest, and seemed to mingle its
        branches with the branches of another tree of a similar gigantic growth
        that grew upon the other side. He walked up to this tree, saying:
        “Nigger went up here!” and at once began to climb. The inclination of
        the great trunk and the lowness of the branches made the task an easy
        one. Almost instantly, Captain Martas, I, and two or three soldiers
        followed Du Chien up the tree. Du Chien had gone up some thirty feet
        into the dense foliage, when all at once he left the body of the tree,
        and began to slide along a great limb that extended out over the water,
        holding to the branches around and above him until he got into the
        lateral branches of the tree on the opposite side, and thence to the
        trunk of that tree, down which he glided, and stood upon the opposite
        bank waiting for us to follow. We did so as speedily as possible, and as
        soon as we were safely landed by his side, Du Chien said: “Single file,
        all!” and started off, smelling the trees and bushes as he went.</p>
      <p>The spot at which we had descended seemed to be a hummock similar to
        that on the other side, but less regular in its outline; and soon the
        way by which Du Chien led us became more and more difficult and
        impassable. Often it seemed that the next step would take us right into
        the dark and sluggish water, but Du Chien, almost without pausing at
        all, would smell at the leaves and branches and hurry on, now planting
        his foot upon a clod just rising out of the water, now stepping upon a
        fallen and half-rotted log, now treading a fringe of more solid ground
        skirting the dreary lagoon, but going every moment deeper and deeper
        into the most pathless and inaccessible portions of the swamp.</p>
      <p>For nearly two hours this strange man followed the trail, and we
        followed him. At last we came to a considerable elevation of ground
        under which opened a little V-shaped valley made by the water of a
        branch which drained the high land into the swamp. This valley was
        rather more than two acres in extent, and seemed to be a clearing. But
        there was a thick-set growth of sweet gum, holly, and magnolia across
        the opening toward the swamp, beyond which we could not see. </p>
      <p>With quickened steps, and with many of the same signs of excitement
        manifested by a hound when the trail grows hot, Du Chien followed along
        this hedge-like line of underbrush, and at its farther end stopped.
        There, within three feet of where the steep bank ran into the water,
        which seemed to be of great depth, was an opening in the hedge. He
        slipped cautiously through it, and we followed him in silence. It was a
        little garden in the heart of the swamp, lying between the hills and the
        water. At the apex of the V-shaped valley was a miserable cabin with
        some fruit trees growing round about it. We gazed upon the scene with
        profound astonishment.</p>
      <p>“Do you know anything of this place, Captain Martas?” said I, in a low
        tone.</p>
      <p>“No,” said he; “several years ago one of my fieldhands, a gigantic
        Abyssinian, was whipped and ran away to the swamp; I never followed him,
        and have never seen him since, although every now and then I heard of
        him by the report of the negroes on the plantation; I suppose he has
        been living somewhere in the swamp ever since, and, unless this is his
        home, I can not imagine how such a place came to be here.”</p>
      <p>“The nigger is there,” said Du Chien. “If there are a dozen of them I
        can tell the right one by the smell,” and again he put the old
        handkerchief to his nose.</p>
      <p>“If it is old Todo,” said Captain Martas, “he is a powerful and
        desperate man, and we had better be cautious.”</p>
      <p>We formed a line, and slowly and cautiously approached. We had got
        within ten or twelve feet of his door, when we saw a gigantic, half-clad
        negro spring from the floor, gaze out at us an instant with fierce,
        startled eyes, and then, with a yell like that of some wild beast roused
        up in its lair, he seized an axe which stood just at the door, and,
        whirling it around his head with savage fury, darted straight at Captain
        Martas. It seemed to me that the huge, black form was actually in the
        air, springing toward the object of its hatred and fear, when one of the
        soldiers sent a ball from his revolver crushing through old Todo’s
        skull. With a savage, beastly cry, the huge bulk fell headlong to the
        earth.</p>
      <p>“It is a pity,” said Martas; “I wished to burn the black devil alive.”
      </p>
      <p>At that instant Du Chien cried out: “Look there!” And extending his arm
        toward the top of the ridge, he started off at full speed. We all looked
        up and saw Celia flying for dear life toward the forest of the high
        ground behind the cabin, and we joined in the chase. It was perhaps
        forty yards up the slope to the highest part, and about the same
        distance down the other side to the water’s edge. Just as we got to the
        crest, Celia, who had already reached the water’s edge, leaped lightly
        into a small canoe and began to ply the paddle vigorously, and with a
        stroke or two sent the frail bark gliding swiftly away from the shore,
        while she looked back at us with a wicked smile. In a moment more she
        would be beyond our reach, and the soldier who had shot Todo leveled his
        fatal revolver at her head. But Captain Martas knocked the weapon up,
        saying, in a voice choked with emotion: “No, no! let the girl go! She is
        my daughter.” </p>
      <p>Swiftly and silently the slight canoe swept away over the dark waters
        of the great, black swamp, now hidden in the shadow, now a moment
        glancing through some little patch of sunlight, always receding farther
        and farther, seen less often, seen less distinctly every moment, and
        then seen no more. </p>

        title='The Amateur Revolutionist'>THE AMATEUR REVOLUTIONIST</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By John Fleming Wilson</div>
      <p>If you should see bronzed men or men with soldierly bearing frequenting
        a certain office in a small street in San Francisco, and if you knew who
        the men were or what they represented, you could predict to a nicety the
        next Central American revolution, its leaders, and its outcome. That is
        because San Francisco is the place where everything commences, and many
        have their end in the way of troubles in the “sister republics.”</p>
      <p>Three years ago the present government of Guatemala missed overthrow by
        just a hair. As the man who had been financing the insurrection said
        bitterly when the bottom fell out: “If it weren’t for women there’d be
        no revolutions, and if it weren’t for a woman every revolution would be
        successful.” He said this to the man who knows more about troubles
        political where there’s money and fighting than any other man in the
        world. This man nodded his head with a smile not often seen on his spare
        face. The financier didn’t like the look, and he growled some more:
        “They might at least have let me hold the government up for my expenses
        before calling the whole business off. I could have got everything back
        and interest on my venture.” </p>
      <p>The other man kept on smiling. “That’s the way you fellows look at it.
        If you can’t win, sell out at a good price. But that don’t win in the
        long run. One woman can spoil the scheme.”</p>
      <p>Two years before this a young woman landed from the Pacific Mail
        steamer <i>City of Para</i>, and registered at the Palace as from
        Mazatlan. She had a little maid who giggled and talked Mexican, some
        luggage with Vienna and Paris hotel labels over it, and the manner of a
        deposed queen. She signed herself as “Srta Maria Rivas.”</p>
      <p>In due time Señorita Rivas left the hotel for quiet lodgings on Vallejo
        Street. But before she disappeared from the court, a gentle-mannered old
        man, with knotty hands, called and introduced a companion. “This is the
        young man I spoke to your excellency about. I present Señor Thomas
        Vincent.” Then the gray-haired man slipped away, and Thomas Vincent was
        left looking down into the dark face of Maria Rivas. He did not know why
        he was there, nor who she was, nor even the name of the man who had
        introduced him. But he was not sorry.</p>
      <p>She let him stand while she glanced him over. Vincent drew himself up
        at her somewhat insolent manner, and was rewarded by a smile.</p>
      <p>“Will you accept an invitation to supper to-night if I press you very
        hard?” she asked him in smooth English.</p>
      <p>Vincent turned his eyes about the court. Then he looked down at her
        again, and nodded curtly. “Certainly, madam.” He flushed, and went on,
        “But I failed to catch your name. I am awfully embarrassed.”</p>
      <p>She got to her feet, and held out a slender hand. “I am Miss Mary
        Rivas,” she said, quietly. “My father was formerly the president of
        Honduras. I went to school at Bryn Mawr, and I met your sister there.
        That’s why, when I found you were in San Francisco, I asked to have you
        brought and introduced.”</p>
      <p>Vincent looked at her very soberly, almost pityingly. Then he offered
        her his arm, and they went into the supper-room, where everybody turned
        to watch their progress, knowing neither of them. </p>
      <p>When she removed to the flat on Vallejo Street, Miss Mary Rivas told
        Vincent to come and take the first dinner with her. “We’ll christen the
        new place,” she said gayly, “and, besides, I hope you’ll find that I’m
        really American and can cook.”</p>
      <p>That night at nine o’clock when the Mexican maid had departed giggling
        to the kitchen, Vincent’s hostess leaned forward over the table at which
        they sat, and rested her elbows on it. Her bare arms framed her face in
        a sudden way that took Vincent’s heart out of its regular beat. He
        leaped to his feet when Maria Rivas, dropping her head, burst into a
        torrent of sobs, her white shoulders heaving as her agony got the better
        of her.</p>
      <p>As he stood there biting his lips she threw back her head and darted up
        and to the window. He heard her moan, as if she saw and heard something
        too awful to comprehend. He walked over and stood back of her till she
        swung round, and he saw the tear-stained face relax and the swimming
        eyes close. He carried her to the table, and laid her down across it,
        and rubbed her hands. Then the maid came in, still giggling
        hysterically, and together they revived her until she sat up between
        Vincent’s arms and slid from the big table to the floor. Vincent sent
        the astonished maid out by a gesture of command. </p>
      <p>“Now, what’s the matter?” he demanded, hoarsely. “If you’re in trouble
        tell me.”</p>
      <p>She panted before him. “It was what I remembered,” she replied. “How
        can I forget?”</p>
      <p>“After I had been five years in the States papa sent for me to meet him
        in Colon. I got off the steamer, and he was waiting on the wharf. I knew
        he would do it just that way. He put on his glasses with both hands and
        looked at me as if he were very glad, and oh! I loved it, for it was
        just like it was when I was a little girl and ran into the big room.</p>
      <p>“But trouble came in Panama, and papa thought we’d better come up to
        San Francisco. ‘I’ve been so busy down here one way and another,’ he
        said, ‘that I’m always suspected of conspiracy. Your mother is dead, and
        the fun of life is out of it. We will live peaceably as befits an old
        man and his daughter.’”</p>
      <p>Vincent’s voice broke in on her story. “When was this?”</p>
      <p>“Five years ago. And everything went all right till we got to Amapala.
        There a friend of papa’s came on board and showed me a paper. It said
        papa was not to be allowed to land in Honduras, as he was plotting an
        insurrection. He put on his glasses to read it. When he looked up at me,
        he said: ‘We shan’t see where your mother is buried, nor the place where
        you were born.’ He shook hands with the friend, and said nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>“On the day we were at Ocos, in the afternoon, I saw the
        <i>comandante</i> come on the steamer with some soldiers. He said he
        wanted to arrest papa, but that if papa came along willingly he would
        not use force.</p>
      <p>“‘I am under the American flag,’ papa said. ‘I know who has done this.
        It would mean my death if I went with you.’ Suddenly I heard a shot and
        then another. I hurried to papa’s room. Outside there were two soldiers
        aiming into it. I saw papa sitting on his camp-stool and his two
        revolvers were in his lap. He was hunting for his glasses, but the chain
        had slipped down. He could not see to shoot. One of the soldiers, after
        a long time, fired his gun again, and father suddenly picked up his
        revolvers, and I cried out again. He didn’t shoot, and I know now that
        he was afraid of hitting me. Then he fell. The soldiers fired again and
        ran away, panting and yelling to each other. I went in to papa, and he
        asked for his glasses, sitting up on the floor very weakly. When I found
        them and gave them to him, the blood was running very fast down his
        breast. He put on his glasses with both hands, wrinkling up his forehead
        in the old way, and looked at me very&#8212;&#8212;He looked.... He
        said, ‘I am glad I could see you, little one ... before I go.’ That was
        all.” </p>
      <p>She went to the window and stayed there, immobile, while Vincent walked
        up and down behind her. At last she turned around. “That was five years
        ago. No one has done anything to punish them.”</p>
      <p>Vincent, because she was suddenly to him the woman, did what every man
        once in his life will do for one woman: he sacrificed his sense of
        humor. With all seriousness he stiffened up. “It was under my flag he
        was shot down. I’ve served under it. Give me another flag for Guatemala
        and I’ll go down there and those murderers shall die against a wall,
        with your flag flying over their heads, its shadow wavering at their
        feet on the yellow sand.”</p>
      <p>Maria Rivas, because she was the Woman in this case, understood
        perfectly. “A revolution?” she said, very quietly. He bent over her hand
        gravely and youthfully. His manner was confident, as if he saw very
        clearly what was to be done and knew how to do it, not as if he had
        promised a girl with tear stains on her cheeks to overturn a government
        because of a murder one afternoon on a steamer in a foreign port.</p>
      <p>This was the beginning of the affair. Its continuation was in a little
        town on the Guatemalan coast, where Vincent landed with a ton of
        munitions of war, marked “Manufactures of Metal,” and thirty ragged
        soldiers. A month later he had a thousand insurgents and twenty tons of
        munitions, and his blood had drunk in the fever that burns up the years
        in hours. The first thing Vincent did under its spell was to march on
        Ocos and take it. When the town was his and the <i>comandante</i> in
        irons, the young man took out of his pocketbook a little list of names,
        made out in Maria Rivas’s hand. He compared this list with the list of
        prisoners, and ordered out a firing squad. Half an hour later the shadow
        of the flag made by the Woman in the Vallejo Street flat wavered over
        the sand on which lay six men in a tangle. Generalissimo Thomas Vincent
        went out into the sun and looked at the last postures of the six, and
        then out across the brimming waters of the Pacific. A mail steamer lay
        out there in the midst of a cluster of canoes, the American flag
        drooping from her staff. </p>
      <p>An Irishman in a major’s uniform came out of the cool of the barracks
        and stopped beside Vincent. “Another week ought to see us in the
        capital,” he said slowly. “But I don’t like this business, general.
        These beggars don’t amount to anything. Why did you order them shot?”
      </p>
      <p>A barefoot girl of some ten years crept around the corner of the
        sunbaked wall. She picked her way over the sand, darting hot glances
        fearfully at the two officers. Suddenly she stooped over the crooked
        body of one of the motionless ones. She tugged at the sleeve of a shirt,
        and as the face turned slightly upward to her effort, she fell to
        beating on the ground with both hands, and sobbed in the heat, dry-eyed.
      </p>
      <p>Vincent strode over to her, and gently picked her up. Her quick sobs
        did not cease as he carried her into the shade, his own face drawn and
        white. He looked over at the major, who stood gnawing on his stubby
        mustache. He did not reply to the question until the major repeated it
        angrily. “It was because ... they deserved it....” Vincent stopped, and
        then went on, almost inaudibly, “God knows why I did it, and then
        there’s ... the&#8212;&#8212;” He stopped once more, for the girl’s hard
        sobs had ceased, and her lithe hand had darted from the folds of her
        scanty gown to the young general’s throat, and the major saw him set the
        burden softly down, and then fall forward, the blood pouring around the
        blade of a knife deep in his throat. </p>
      <p>With an oath the major leaped over to him and lifted his head.
        Vincent’s eyes looked clearly into his. Then the wounded man looked over
        at the little girl, poised for flight, a dozen feet away. He nodded at
        her with an air of absolute comprehension, and then died. </p>

      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Neil Gillespie</div>
      <p>“A short, severe war is less cruel than a long drawn-out fight,” said
        the captain, easily. “Of course it is! Everybody knows it! So why do the
        people at home criticise us, and libel and court-martial us because we
        use every means in our power to prevent further rebellion?”</p>
      <p>“They ought to be thankful we don’t use Spanish methods,” said Wilcox,
        the junior member of the mess. He was only six weeks out of his cadet
        gray, and a new arrival at Camp Chicobang.</p>
      <p>The captain smiled, pleasantly. “No?” he said. “Haven’t we a
        <i>reconcentrado</i> system similar to theirs? Haven’t we a blockade?
        We’re merely taking up affairs where they left them, and following
        Spanish methods in our own way. When this rebellion began, we tried to
        treat the natives as civilized creatures, but, thank heaven, we’re
        learning sense at last.”</p>
      <p>The subaltern flushed to the roots of his close-cropped hair. “Do you
        mean to say that any measure, however cruel, is justifiable in war?”</p>
      <p>“About that,” said the captain, amused at the boy’s interest in a
        subject which was a stale one to the rest of the mess. “This business
        has got to be straightened out, and that’s exactly what you and I are
        here for. War is wrong; therefore it is cruel and brutalizing.
        ‘Benevolent assimilation’ talk is all rot, and as for civilized warfare,
        there’s no such thing. The measures used are adopted as circumstances
        arise, and must be cruel or barbarous, as the necessity calls for.” </p>
      <p>Wilcox was staring at him, half in horror, half in fascination. “And
        men can talk that way in the twentieth century,” he murmured. </p>
      <p>The captain smiled again. “The only way to carry on war with this
        people is to do to them as they first did to us. As long as we spare
        them, they’re going to think we’re weaklings, and grow bolder by result.
        They haven’t any honor; you can’t treat them as white men. Their own
        methods are what they expect, and their own methods are the only means
        by which this fighting will ever be stopped. It may involve an awful lot
        of suffering for non-combatants, but we can’t help that. When the people
        cry out ‘Enough!’ then the insurgents will lose their support and the
        rebellion will be at an end&#8212;for a while.”</p>
      <p>Wilcox was playing nervously with his fork, and biting his lips as if
        to keep back words he would not speak. He was young, and his high ideals
        of the calling he had chosen had made him blind to the hard facts with
        which he was now brought face to face. It was impossible to believe that
        his own countrymen&#8212;officers of the United States army&#8212;could
        be so cruel, so barbarous. He did not care what the captain said; bloody
        treatment must serve only to alienate this struggling people. If the
        rebellion had once been handled differently, what was the cause of this
        reversion to the savage? Had the lust of blood so crazed the white men
        that they forgot their race, their civilization, their upbringing?
        Wilcox pitied the Filipinos; they, at least, were fighting for their
        liberty.</p>
      <p>“By the way,” said the captain, “did any of you fellows hear that the
        general expects to catch Luiz Maha, who killed our policeman down at
        Binaran, and tried to murder the port commander?”</p>
      <p>“Been wounded?” asked some one.</p>
      <p>“No, but his wife had a baby recently, so he probably won’t move his
        quarters so easily. They’ll shoot him on sight.”</p>
      <p>“Well, I hope they see him soon,” said the medico. “He’s made more
        trouble for us than any other <i>insurrecto</i> in that part of the
        island.”</p>
      <p>A sudden sound of running feet was heard through the din of the rain
        outside. The door of the mess-hall rasped open, and a dripping figure
        appeared on the threshold.</p>
      <p>“The colonel’s compliments to the commanders of K and O Troops, and
        will they please report to him immediately? Outpost No. 2 has been cut
        up by <i>insurrectos</i>, and Lieutenant Ellard and men at No. 4 have
        been captured.”</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>In the blackness of the night before dawn, a long line of men, lying
        flat on the soggy earth, wormed their way through the tall, rank grass.
        On the crest of a steep ascent the leading figures halted cautiously,
        and one by one the men came to a standstill, each with a hand on the
        foot of the man ahead. A light was beginning to streak the east when the
        captain consulted the native guide in a soundless colloquy.</p>
      <p>“What does he say?” asked Wilcox, the subaltern. He was wallowing in
        the mud like a carabao, and his clothes were coated with dirt. </p>
      <p>“The <i>hacienda</i> of the <i>insurrecto comandante</i> is just below
        us,” returned the captain. “They’ll be perfectly unsuspecting, and
        unless they’ve had time to move on, it’s likely we’ll find our men
        hidden there.”</p>
      <p>In the gray dawn the Americans drew their lines about the little
        plantation, and lay in an unseen circle a stone’s throw from the brown
        nipa-hut. The subaltern saw a frowsy woman with two naked children go
        into the shack. A tall man in ragged white was putting out the wash to
        dry.</p>
      <p>“By the eternal,” whispered the captain, excitedly, “if it isn’t a
        Spaniard! We’ve had rumors that the Gugus were keeping some prisoners up
        here as slaves.”</p>
      <p>The tall man glanced toward the jungle and saw a line of blue and
        khaki-clad figures spring into view. His eyes bulged from his head, and
        he stood motionless with amazement. Suddenly, with a shout of “Vivan los
        Americanos! Viva la Libertad!” he dashed forward, open-armed. A burly
        sergeant met him with a knock-out blow on the chin, and the Spaniard
        staggered back, rubbing his face without resentment. He understood that
        silence was demanded.</p>
      <p>“Over the hill!” he cried, dancing about with pain and excitement.
        “They’ve just left here with three <i>Americano</i> prisoners. Hurry and
        you will catch them! Hurry, hurry, but take me with you.” </p>
      <p>Once more they dashed into the forest. The subaltern, running beside
        the rescued man, noticed that his shirt was stained with blood, and the
        fluttering rags gave glimpses of the raw, flayed skin beneath.</p>
      <p>“What does that mean?” he asked in his school-boy Spanish.</p>
      <p>The man smiled. Past sorrows were nothing to him now.</p>
      <p>“I have been two years a prisoner,” he said. “One receives many
        beatings.” </p>
      <p>“Have you never tried to escape?”</p>
      <p>“What was the use? My friend tried, but they caught him and cut off his
        head&#8212;after roasting his legs.”</p>
      <p>Wilcox said nothing, but there was a strained look about his eyes. To
        him the last twenty-four hours had been horribly unreal. Stopping only
        for food and drink, the troop had followed the track of the
        <i>insurrectos</i> deeper and deeper into the hills. He had seen his men
        surprise and shoot down a native in sight of his wife, and as excuse the
        captain had said that the man was a war traitor, a leader of insurgents,
        and a persecutor of <i>Americanistas</i>. But Wilcox felt sickened. The
        captain and the men became repulsive to him. They were like a lower
        order of beings to which he refused to be degraded. The army was his
        only outlook, but could he ever be in sympathy with such things as he
        was experiencing every day?</p>
      <p>Suddenly a man in the ranks cried out, and the column came to a jolting
        halt. The subaltern looked, and turned pale. By the trunk of a
        moss-grown tree, his arms bound above his head, a rope about his
        half-naked body, stood an American soldier. Across his mouth from corner
        to corner a <i>bolo</i> had slashed, and the bleeding flesh hung loosely
        over the jaw. His head was sunk forward, but he was not dead as his
        captors had intended he should be after a few days’ lingering. </p>
      <p>His “bunkie,” who had first seen the pitiful figure, cut the heavy hemp
        with his bayonet, but the column waited only a moment. A hospital corps
        man was left behind with a detail, and the troop took up its march the
        more cautiously for knowing that it was hot on the trail.</p>
      <p>The subaltern felt that his nerves were strained to the breaking point.
        Through the throbbing whirl of his brain came a sickening thought. If
        the natives were capable of such a deed as this, how would they treat
        the other two prisoners? Surely they would not dare to harm an American
        officer. His mind refused to comprehend the thought of Ellard cold and
        lifeless. The image of his classmate and chum was too fresh, too vividly
        active to be rendered null. No, the natives could not be so cruel, they
        could not be so inhuman. And yet that bound figure by the tree! How
        slowly the men moved! Why did they linger when every minute might mean
        life or death to the prisoners?</p>
      <p>The men passed over another spur and dropped into the valley below.
        With every step they moved more cautiously. Tense and alert, the
        subaltern crept onward, braced for he knew not what. He saw the captain,
        crawling on all fours, become entangled in a trailing vine, and felt an
        uncontrollable desire to laugh. It was broad day now, and the heat grew
        stifling in the breathless woods.</p>
      <p>A shout and distant laughter echoed across the valley, and the captain
        halted abruptly. After a moment’s consultation, the troop divided, and
        at the head of his creeping file, the subaltern turned to the right.
        Nearer and nearer sounded the native voices, and the men knew that they
        were close to the insurgent camp. For ten heartbreaking minutes they
        wormed their way over the damp, brown loam, now and again catching a
        glimpse of the little clearing, until they had made a complete half
        circle.</p>
      <p>Slowly they drew near the edge of the trees, and the subaltern heard
        the sound of hasty digging. A strange look appeared on the set faces of
        the men, but Wilcox did not notice. He wondered what the natives were
        doing, fearing to look for dread of what he might have to see, and yet
        impatient to know if Ellard was alive. He moved his body until,
        dirt-color himself, he could watch unseen.</p>
      <p>Thank God! At the opposite end of the clearing stood Ellard, upright
        and unharmed. Before him, in the centre of the field, was a rectangular
        hole like a grave, and the natives were throwing the earth clods into
        it. Evidently they were burying some one who had died, but why did they
        seem amused? Brady was nowhere in sight. Was it his body they were
        burying?</p>
      <p>Yelling like an army of blue fiends, the captain’s detachment burst
        into the clearing. Surprised and confused, the <i>insurrectos</i> turned
        to flee, and met the fixed bayonets of the subaltern’s men. </p>
      <p>As soon as he could break away, Wilcox ran to one side. Ellard was
        standing as before, still bound hand and foot. His face was half
        averted, but on it the subaltern saw a look of the most intense horror
        and dread. With a cry of dismay, he dashed forward, but a naked, brown
        figure was before him. Twice the shining <i>kris</i> flashed in the air
        as the defenseless prisoner toppled backward. Then, dodging the
        subaltern’s bullet, the native turned and fled. Two privates cornered
        and disarmed him, but before they could put in a finishing blow, Wilcox
        had shouted: “Hold on there! Wait till I come!” </p>
      <p>“As you have mercy, put me out of this life!” moaned Ellard.</p>
      <p>The tall, strong, young athlete of a moment before lay helpless on the
        ground, a bleeding, legless trunk. Sobbing, the subaltern dropped to his
        knees beside his friend, and beat passionately at the earth with
        clenched fists.</p>
      <p>“Don’t, don’t!” almost shrieked the wounded man. “I stood here
        powerless to move while they first cut up and then buried Brady alive,
        but I didn’t cry! Kill me, shoot me, have mercy on me for Christ’s sake,
        but don’t cry!”</p>
      <p>A hospital sergeant came running, the captain, white with horror, at
        his heels. The fight was over, and a group of men were working at the
        grave.</p>
      <p>Wilcox staggered to his feet, a strange curse on his lips. The beads of
        sweat plowed deep courses through the grime on his cheeks. Slowly, with
        infinite deliberation, he reloaded his revolver and strode to where the
        troopers held the <i>insurrecto</i> on the ground. As he went, he
        muttered, like a man searching for some forgotten thought, “The measures
        used are adopted as circumstances arise, and must be cruel or barbarous
        as the necessity calls for ... as the necessity calls for....”</p>
      <p>Three times he fired into the prostrate body. “One for Brady, one for
        Wright, and one for Ellard!” and then he began to laugh.</p>

      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Bertrand W. Sinclair.</div>
      <p>“Mormon Jack” stretched his generous length in the shade of the
        bed-wagon, thereby disturbing the sonorous slumbers of Johnny Layton,
        who muttered imprecations as he rolled over to make room. </p>
      <p>“You blasted Mormon renegade,” he growled.</p>
      <p>“Why don’t you go and lie down where you won’t be disturbin’ a fellow
        that has to stand guard to-night?”</p>
      <p>“You’re a cantankerous cuss,” Mormon Jack calmly returned. “If I wasn’t
        a stranger in a hostile camp I’d climb your carcass for them insultin’
        observations. Besides, it aint good for a kid to sleep too much. I don’t
        see how you got the heart to lay here snorin’ like a cayuse chokin’
        down, when you could be sittin’ up enjoyin’ this here beautiful scenery
        that’s bein’ desecrated with bawlin’ cows and buckin’ bronks and greasy,
        old round-up wagons. You aint got no sense of nacheral beauty, Kid.
        You’re just about as ornery a varmint as old man Hartley, what once
        inhabited this same flat.” </p>
      <p>“I’ve heard of him,” answered the now thoroughly awakened Layton. “He
        happened before my time, though. Were you in the country when they
        cleaned him out?”</p>
      <p>“You bet I was!” Mormon Jack replied. “I knew him before he came over
        here, and I was here and saw his finish. There was high old jinks on
        this little green bottom that day.”</p>
      <p>“So I’ve heard. He wanted to make a sheep-feedin’ ground of the east
        bench, didn’t he? How was it?” Layton propped himself up on his elbow to
        listen. </p>
      <p>Mormon Jack settled his head comfortably against a rolled-up bed. He
        rolled a cigarette daintily and inhaled many breaths of smoke before
        replying.</p>
      <p>“Old man Hartley was a bone-headed cuss,” he began, at length, “that
        wouldn’t learn better&#8212;even by experience. He was like a fool
        buck-sheep that persists in buttin’ everything that gets in his way, no
        matter how much he hurts his head. It aint the sheep’s fault; it’s the
        breed of him, and the way he was raised&#8212;and I guess that was the
        trouble with old Hartley.</p>
      <p>“I come across him, first time, over in the Hash-Knife country, a
        little while after they quit drivin’ herds up the Long Trail. The
        railway come in, and you could bring a bunch of cattle from the
        Panhandle up there in a week&#8212;it took five months on the trail.
        Likewise, the railway brought farmers and pilgrims and woolly-backs by
        the train-load, and turned ’em loose promiscus on the country, where
        they made more trouble with their homestead rights and barb-wire fences
        than all the Injuns that ever run buffalo or lifted hair.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t long till there was heaps of trouble on the range. A
        tenderfoot would file on a claim, prove up, and as soon as he got his
        papers a big sheep outfit would own the land&#8212;you know how they do.
        Pretty soon the big sheepmen began to fence the water-holes, claim or no
        claim, and hell broke loose. After considerable killin' and burnin' and
        layin' for each other, they patched up a peace; the sheepmen that didn't
        get killed off stayed on the creeks where they was settled, and the cow
        outfits held what was left of the open range.</p>
      <p>“That was where old Hartley got in his work. He had a bunch of sheep,
        and stay where he belonged he wouldn't. He'd slip out on good grass and
        fence up a spring or little lake that might be waterin' a thousand head
        of cattle. If a bunch of cows come in to water, he'd sic his dogs on 'em
        till they'd quit the earth. If a round-up swung his way he'd knock down
        his fence and move out. It was a big country and hard to watch, but they
        caught him once or twice, and drove him back where he belonged. They
        give him all the show in the world to be on the square, but he
        wouldn't&#8212;he wasn't built that way. He swore 'by God' that he had
        as much right to drive his blatin', stinkin' woolly-backs all over the
        range as the cowmen had to turn their longhorns loose on the country. He
        was a big, burly, noisy-mouthed cuss, with the muscle of a pack-mule and
        the soul of a prairie-dog. He was game, for all his low-down ways, but
        he went up against the cowmen once too often; a round-up headed him
        north one day with his sheep and a camp-wagon, and sent a couple of
        riders along to see that he kept a-goin'. Then they swung around to his
        home ranch and made a bonfire of it, to show the rest of the ca-na-na's
        that there'd be no monkey business on the Hash-Knife range.</p>
      <p>“I didn't see nor hear of him no more till that fall. Then the layout I
        was workin' for bought a bunch of cattle over here and sent me to rep
        for 'em&#8212;same as I’m doin’ now. I was huntin’ for the Big Four
        wagon, which was supposed to be workin’ on the upper part of the White
        Mud, when I struck his trail. Comin’ north along the creek one day I
        turned a bend and come on a fellow talkin’ to a girl. It was Stella
        Hartley. I met her once at a dance on Powder River, and I knowed her the
        minute I laid eyes on her. She was about as nice a little girl as ever
        struck Custer County.</p>
      <p>“I rode up and says ‘Howdy’ to her, and then I see it was Bobby Collins
        she was talkin’ to. I knew him, too&#8212;one of the whitest boys on
        earth, and the swiftest woddy that ever turned a cow. ‘Hash-Knife Bob’
        they called him, over in Custer. </p>
      <p>“‘M’ son,’ says I, ‘I’m sure glad to see you. But how’d you come to
        stray off into this wilderness?’</p>
      <p>“He told me, then, the whole deal, Stella sittin’ on her horse tryin’
        to smile, though she was nearer cryin’ than anything else; she’d been
        sheddin’ tears pretty considerable, as it was. Away along in the winter
        Stella ’d promised to marry him, but when the old man got to hear of it
        he just tore up the earth and swore he’d rather see her dead than
        married to a cowpuncher. Hash-Knife was for tellin’ him to go to the
        devil and gettin’ married anyway, but Stella wouldn’t have it that way.
        His wife bein’ dead, she was the only womankind the old man had, and she
        couldn’t bear to leave him like that. She said to wait awhile and the
        old man would come around. So in the spring Bob goes to the head of
        Powder River, and while he was gone the cow outfits put the run on the
        old man. When Hash-Knife comes back, Stella and the whole Hartley outfit
        had vanished plum off the earth.</p>
      <p>“But Hash-Knife Bob was no quitter. He followed ’em up and located ’em
        on Milk River. Then he got a job with the Big Four, so’s to be near the
        girl. He had it figured out that when round-up was over that fall he’d
        take up a ranch on Milk River, marry Stella, and settle down. But he
        hadn’t more’n made his plan when old man Hartley breaks out in a fresh
        place.</p>
      <p>“As I said before, old Hartley was a bull-headed old bucko. He was
        worse’n that; he was pig-headed and sheep-headed; he had the contrary
        stubbornness of all the no-account animals on God’s green earth. You’d
        ’a’ thought he’d ’a’ taken a tumble to himself after livin’ so long in a
        sagebrush country, and ’specially after bein’ run out of one part of it.
        But, no, sir! his way was <i>the</i> way. He wasn’t content on Milk
        River&#8212;he wanted a whole blamed county to graze over. So he went
        pokin’ around on the north side, and stumbled onto the Crossin’ here. It
        looked good to him, and without sayin’ a word to anybody but his
        herder&#8212;who was a knot-head like himself and crazy after
        Stella&#8212;he picks up his traps and sashays in here.</p>
      <p>“There was probably seven or eight big cow outfits rangin’ east of the
        White Mud then, and they’d just got through havin’ a scrap with the
        sheep-wranglers, alongside of which the fuss in Custer County was about
        knee-high. Both of ’em had lots of men and money, but the advantage was
        on the cowmen’s side, for their boys was fightin’ for their livin’, for
        outfits they’d been raised with, and the sheepherders was in it for coin
        and because they didn’t know any better. Anyway, the sheepmen backed off
        after awhile and made peace&#8212;said they’d be good, they’d had
        enough. The cowmen made the White Mud the dead line; there was to be no
        sheep-camps on the creek or east of it. And the cowpunchers rode the
        high pinnacles to see that no sheep crossed the line.</p>
      <p>“This here, Hash-Knife explained to me, was the way things stood:
        Hartley was located on the Crossin’ with a bunch of sheep&#8212;about
        twenty-five hundred head. He’d built him a cabin, and had likewise
        strung a four-strand barb-wire fence across the coulée that led down to
        the flat. And he was goin’ to stay there, he said. He had a squatter’s
        right, and if he wanted to live there and fence his place he’d do it. It
        was government land, and to hell with the cow outfits! He was from
        Missouri, he was! And up on the bench, about six or seven miles back,
        the Big Four and the Ragged H was swingin’ up to the Crossin’ with a
        beef herd apiece, and the wagon-bosses was mad, for they’d heard of old
        man Hartley.</p>
      <p>“‘Old “Peek-a-Boo” Johnson’s runnin’ the Big Four,’ Hash-Knife told me.
        ‘I got him to let me ride ahead and see if I couldn’t talk some sense
        into the old man. But it’s no go. He’s got his neck bowed, and he’s fool
        ’nough to try and run a whizzer on Peek-a-Boo’s riders; they’ll clean
        him out if he does. I saw Stella ride off as I was comin’ down to the
        ranch, and when I got through with him I rambled down this way and found
        her. I want her to stay away from the flat for two or three hours, till
        the thing is settled one way or the other, but she’s bound to go home.
        So I guess we’d better be goin’. The wagons ought to hit the Crossin’
        pretty soon.’</p>
      <p>“We went up on the bench. Stella and Hash-Knife and me, and loped along
        toward the Crossin’. Pretty soon we could see the two sets of wagons and
        a bunch of riders headin’ for the creek, the two herds&#8212;big
        ones&#8212;trailin’ along behind, about a mile apart. At the head of the
        coulée I turned my string loose for the horse-wrangler to pick up. With
        Stella cryin’ and Hash-Knife tryin’ to comfort her, we swung down the
        coulée to the shack.</p>
      <p>“When we got there we found the herder had brought the sheep in to
        water. They’d moved back off water and was bedded down, bunched close,
        about half-way between the cabin and the creek. There was three of ’em
        at the cabin; old Hartley, the herder, and a pilgrim that’d come out to
        work on the ranch.</p>
      <p>“Old Hartley looked pretty black at us as we rode up, but he didn’t
        have time to say much before the wagons come rollin’ out the mouth of
        the coulée. They was almost at the house before he knowed it. Then he
        ducked into the cabin and come out with a Winchester across his arm. The
        outfit went past without battin’ an eye at him. They went round the
        sheep and started to pitch camp on the creek-bank. Then Peek-a-Boo and
        Tom Jordan, the Ragged H boss, come a-ridin’ up to the cabin. </p>
      <p>“They was nice and polite about it. They told old Hartley that seein’
        he was a stranger they thought he’d probably made a mistake and got over
        on the wrong side of the ridge. They didn’t want to make any trouble for
        him, but he’d have to take his sheep off the creek. Sorry to bother him,
        but it was range law.</p>
      <p>“‘You can’t bluff <i>me</i>,’ says Hartley. ‘This here’s government
        land. I got as much right here as anybody. You dassent run me out.’ </p>
      <p>“Then old Tom Jordan tells him about the big scrap they’d had with the
        sheepmen, and how they’d agreed to stay the other side of the ridge, but
        the old bonehead kept a-shootin’ off about his rights, and how they
        couldn’t bluff <i>him</i>, till Tom got mad and rode off, sayin’ that
        he’d see his blasted sheep was across the ridge by sundown.</p>
      <p>“Peek-a-Boo stayed talkin’ to him, tryin’ to persuade him to be
        reasonable, and showin’ him how foolish he was to run up against the
        cowmen after they’d fought a dozen big sheep outfits to a standstill and
        whacked up the range fair and square. They talked and talked, old
        Hartley gettin’ more and more on the peck. Neither of ’em noticed that
        the lead of the first herd had strung down the coulée&#8212;the
        cowpunchers had done business with the fence. There was probably a
        thousand head of big, rollicky steers bunched on the flat, and the rest
        of the herd was pourin’ out the mouth of the draw. Two point-riders was
        holdin’ ’em up so they wouldn’t scatter. </p>
      <p>“Old Hartley saw ’em first. The sight of that big bunch of longhorns on
        what he called his land made him see red, I reckon. He shoved the lever
        of his gun forward and back, clickity-click, and started on a run for
        the bunch, hollerin’ as he went: ‘You can’t drive them cattle across my
        flat! I’ll kill you, by God, if you do!’ </p>
      <p>“Peek-a-Boo stuck the spurs in his horse, and started after him,
        callin’ to him to keep away from the herd. Hartley kept a-goin’ till
        Peek was about twenty feet from him, then he whirled with his gun to his
        shoulder, and cut loose, bang&#8212;bang! and Peek-a-Boo tumbled off his
        horse.</p>
      <p>“Things happened then. Stella had started after the old man, but
        Hash-Knife grabbed her and made her stop. When old Hartley dropped
        Peek-a-Boo, Bob says to me: ‘Mormon, take Stella over to camp. I got to
        get Peek out of there. Maybe he aint killed, and them steers’ll be
        a-runnin’ over him in about ten seconds.’</p>
      <p>“Hash-Knife had the situation sized up correct. I helped Stella onto
        her horse and started for the wagons. A lot of riders come like hell
        across the flat toward the herd, but they was too late to do any good.
        Just as Hash-Knife picked old Peek-a-Boo up and flopped him across his
        horse, Hartley begin to smoke up the two riders that was holdin’ the
        herd&#8212;which was bunched tight, ready to run. But he missed first
        shot, and when he fired the second time they was scuddin’ for the
        tail-end of the herd, layin’ low along the backs of their horses. As
        they run they jerked the slickers off the backs of their saddles,
        swingin’ ’em round their heads, and, yellin’ like Gros Ventre braves
        strikin’ the war-post, they rode into the herd. </p>
      <p>“When them cattle surged first one way and then the other, and then
        swept across the flat, tramplin’ old Hartley down like he was a lone
        stalk of bunch-grass stickin’ up out of the prairie, Stella screeched
        and hid her face in her hands. But I watched; it was horrible and
        fascinatin’. You’ve seen the ice gorge in the Big Muddy, when it breaks
        up in the spring; it jams at some narrow place and piles up and piles up
        till the river below is bone dry. Then the weight of the water’ll bust
        the jam and there’ll be a grindin’, smashin’ uproar for a minute, and
        all of a sudden the river is flowin’ peaceful again.</p>
      <p>“That was the way them cattle did. They passed over old Hartley like he
        was nothin’, and struck that bunch of slumberin’ sheep like a breakin’
        ice jam. Two thousand strong they was, runnin’ like scared antelope,
        packed shoulder to shoulder, with horns and hoofs clatterin’ like a
        Spanish dancer’s castanets, and the gallopin’ weight of ’em made the
        flat tremble. This wise they passed over the band of sheep, wipin’ ’em
        out like the spring floods wipe out the snow in the low places, and
        thunderin’ by the round-up camp hit the creek with a rush that knocked
        it dry for a hundred yards. The lead of ’em had hardly got to the level
        before the riders was turnin’ ’em. In fifteen minutes them cattle was
        standin’ bunched on the flat, puffin’ and blowin’, the big steers
        starin’ round as if they were wonderin’ what had scared ’em. But they’d
        done the trick. There was no sheep left to quarrel over&#8212;nary one.
        It was an Alamo for the woolly-backs!</p>
      <p>“After we’d found and buried what was left of old man Hartley, we moved
        up the creek to camp. The herder and the pilgrim hit the trail for Milk
        River. Poor little Stella sure felt bad on account of the old man, and
        the boys was all sorry for her. But she had Hash-Knife, and
        Peek-a-Boo&#8212;who wasn’t hurt bad enough to make him cash
        in&#8212;said he’d brand a hundred calves for her on the spring
        round-up. So I guess she was winner on the deal.</p>
      <p>“That’s been eleven years,” Mormon Jack concluded, reminiscently, “and
        I aint been here since. I didn’t make no protracted visit the first
        time, but I want to tell you, m’ son, it was sure excitin’.” </p>

        title='The Colonel and “The Lady”'>THE COLONEL AND “THE LADY”</h2>
      <div class='ce sc mb05'>By Kathleen Thompson</div>
      <p>About an hour before sunset, Colonel Jerry rode furiously into the
        post. Her sweating pony was streaked with dust, and the colonel was
        covered with it from head to foot. Except for the rumpled and brief
        little corduroy skirt and bloomers, her clothing was an exact, if
        miniature, copy of her father’s. Her wide felt hat had its regulation
        cord and tassels, there were gauntlets on her small hands, and gaiters
        on her small legs. The sleeve of her boyish skirt carried its device,
        and she wore a cartridge belt, a little pistol, and a sword.</p>
      <p>She drew her dancing pony sharply up before the group on the porch, and
        saluted severely.</p>
      <p>“And just in time, too!” said the major, who was also the colonel’s
        father. He looked at her reproachfully. “We were about to send a company
        out after you! Leave Baby at the side door and go straight upstairs.
        When you’re presentable come down, and I’ll introduce you to your Boston
        uncle and aunt. We’ve been watching for you all afternoon. What kept
        you, you vagabond?”</p>
      <p>The colonel, trying to quiet her nervous horse, wheeled about in a
        manner that made her aunt dizzy. She answered, jerkily: “Trouble,
        sir&#8212;on the reservation! Whoa, there, pretty! Quiet, girl! It seems
        that&#8212;it seems that some of those hogs of Indians got
        hold&#8212;steady, old girl!&#8212;got hold of a keg of
        whisky&#8212;somewhere&#8212;and&#8212;Peters said&#8212;hold still, you
        fool! You’ll have your oats in a minute!&#8212;Peters said&#8212;that
        last night&#8212;there wasn’t a man in the camp that wasn’t drunk! You
        will have to excuse me, sir! She’s pulling my arms out!” And she gave
        her horse its head.</p>
      <p>When the two had flashed around the corner of the house, the major
        smiled, proudly. “What d’ye think of her?” he said, turning to his
        brother-in-law. </p>
      <p>“Well, for a nine-year-old,” said Dr. Eyre, slowly, “she is certainly a
        wonder!”</p>
      <p>The doctor’s wife, a pretty, precise little woman, looked at her own
        neat little girl, and sighed, profoundly.</p>
      <p>“And <i>this&#8212;this</i>!” she said, plaintively, “is poor Amy’s
        child!” </p>
      <p>The major looked a trifle uncomfortable, but his young aid spoke,
        eagerly: “Every one on the post is proud of the colonel! You see, we’ve
        brought her up here among us, Mrs. Eyre&#8212;taught her everything she
        knows! You can’t take in her good points at a glance&#8212;but she’s as
        square as any man!” </p>
      <p>When the little girl presently joined them, her dark hair had been
        smoothly brushed, her white frock and buckled slippers were
        irreproachable. She gave a cool and impassive little cheek to her aunt’s
        kisses, and then, from her father’s knee, soberly studied her
        kinspeople.</p>
      <p>“How like Amy!” said Mrs. Eyre. “You don’t remember poor dear mamma, do
        you, Geraldine?”</p>
      <p>“I was two,” said the colonel. The aid choked.</p>
      <p>“Yes&#8212;yes&#8212;of course!” said Mrs. Eyre. “And she has had no
        training, has she, Jim? Do you know, darling, that where aunty and
        cousin Rose live they would think you were a very funny little girl if
        they heard you talk that way?”</p>
      <p>“What way, dad?” said the colonel, quickly.</p>
      <p>“And to hear you say what you said this afternoon,” pursued her aunt,
        calmly.</p>
      <p>“To your horse, she means,” supplemented her father, smiling down at
        her. </p>
      <p>“But that horse can act like the Old Harry,” said the colonel,
        musingly. </p>
      <p>“Speaking of horses,” her uncle said, a little hurriedly, “you’ve never
        seen mine, have you?”</p>
      <p>She gave him an eager smile. “No, sir. You know I’ve never been East.
        But I’ve read about her. I’m very much interested in that horse.”</p>
      <p>“Well, after dinner, suppose you and I have a look at her?”</p>
      <p>“<i>What!</i>” The colonel was on her feet; “she’s not <i>here</i>!”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes. Came with us to-day. She’s entered for the Towerton Cup.”</p>
      <p>The colonel’s pale little face was flushed with excitement.</p>
      <p>“You don’t mean The Lady, Uncle Bob? Not the horse that has taken all
        those prizes? Here on <i>this post</i>?”</p>
      <p>“That’s the very one, colonel,” said the major; “we put her in the
        Ralston stable.”</p>
      <p>“The Lady!” said the colonel, dazedly. “The Lady! To think I shall see
        that horse!”</p>
      <p>“Aunts and uncles are nothing to horses,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald.</p>
      <p>“Well,” said the colonel, “you know every one has aunts and uncles.”
        The aid grew crimson again. “But this is the only racer that I know. And
        you’ve put her in the Ralston stable?”</p>
      <p>“For quiet,” her uncle said. “It excites her to be in a stable with
        other horses.”</p>
      <p>“And one thing more, colonel,” said her father, firmly; “which you may
        as well understand right <i>now</i>. You’re not ever, under any
        circumstances, to mount that horse.”</p>
      <p>“All right, sir,” said the colonel, regretfully. “If you say so, that
        goes. But I’d like to try her.”</p>
      <p>Her father gave her a sidelong look.</p>
      <p>“Now see here, Jerry. The minute I catch you on top of that horse, you
        can go to bed without rations, and you needn’t wear your colors for a
        week after. Understand?”</p>
      <p>The colonel nodded. Her face was crimson.</p>
      <p>“Hang it, you’re not <i>my</i> superior officer, Jim,” said his
        brother, smiling, “and if I choose to give my niece a ride or so on my
        own horse it strikes me&#8212;&#8212;”</p>
      <p>“Ah! that’s a different matter,” agreed the major, “only I didn’t want
        the colonel here to think The Lady was an ordinary riding horse.”</p>
      <p>The colonel said nothing. She was, at times, an oddly silent child. But
        she smiled at her uncle, and loved him at once.</p>
      <p>It was almost sunset. Long, clear-cut shadows fell across the
        clean-swept parade. The watering-cart rumbled to and fro, leaving a
        sweet odor of fresh, wet earth. Lawn-sprinklers began to whirr in the
        gardens of Officers’ Row. Chattering groups went by, the level red light
        flashing on white parasols and brass buttons. All of these strollers
        shouted greetings to the major and the little colonel. Some came up, and
        were duly presented to the major’s guests. Jerry sat on the steps, her
        little dark head against the rail, and exchanged banter with a degree of
        equality that astonished her aunt. The child’s heart was full. She was
        to be, for several days, privileged by the sight of the great
        horse&#8212;a week would bring the Fourth of July, with its bands and
        picnic and evening of unclouded joys, fireworks, ice-cream, bonfires.
        Besides this, the old general, her especial crony, would arrive in a few
        days for the holiday.</p>
      <p>Dinner was late and long. And the after-dinner cigars were interrupted
        by many reminiscences. By the time the men reached the porch again, the
        colonel’s patience was sorely strained. She sat waiting for a long
        half-hour.</p>
      <p>“Uncle Bob,” she began at last, when there was a pause, “are you going
        to see The Lady to-night?”</p>
      <p>“By George, that is so,” said her uncle, rousing. “We must have a look
        at the old girl. Come, kids.”</p>
      <p>Just then the breeze brought them the bugle notes.</p>
      <p>“Too bad!” said the aid.</p>
      <p>“Oh, confound it, there’s taps!” said the colonel, tears of vexation in
        her eyes. “You’ll have to go without me.”</p>
      <p>And before they realized it, she had said her good-nights and gone
        upstairs.</p>
      <p>“H’m!” said her uncle, reflectively.</p>
      <p>“She was probably tired and sleepy,” said Mrs. Eyre, gently.</p>
      <p>“She'll be out at that stable at five to-morrow,” said the aid.</p>
      <p>And, sure enough, Colonel Jerry appeared at the nine-o'clock breakfast
        the next day radiant from three hours spent in the great horse's stable.
      </p>
      <p>“Well, colonel,” said her uncle, coming in late, “what do you think of
        The Lady?”</p>
      <p>The plain little face was transformed by a wide smile.</p>
      <p>“Oh, Uncle Bob! I never saw such a horse! Baron let me lead her down to
        water! She's the most beautiful horse I ever saw!”</p>
      <p>“You'll be disobeying your father,” he said, smiling, “and running off
        some day on The Lady's back.” She glanced down at her little sleeve,
        where the device of a colonel was exquisitely embroidered.</p>
      <p>“We'd do a good deal not to have that taken off our sleeve, wouldn't
        we?” said her father.</p>
      <p>“Most anything,” she answered, with her flashing smile.</p>
      <p>Her own little horse was sick, but she and Rose rode the big carriage
        horses every day, and Jerry did her best to entertain this rather
        difficult guest. The two children found enough in common to spend the
        days pleasantly. Rose developed a profound respect for her wild little
        cousin, and Jerry grew to enjoy Rose's company&#8212;even though Rose
        could not obey orders, and held bugle-calls in contempt. Both children,
        as well as all the others on the post, were planning for the Fourth of
        July. All their money went for fireworks, they shouted the national
        songs, they cheered the band that practiced nightly before the house.
      </p>
      <p>The third of July broke hot and cloudless. By nine o’clock, the piazza
        rail burned one’s fingers, and as the hours went by the heat shut down
        over the earth like a blanket. A heavy haze hung over the meadows, and
        lines of heat dazzled up from the far, blue mountains. Jerry, coming out
        from an hour’s enforced practice on her violin, stretched luxuriously in
        the heat. The post seemed deserted. The heat beat steadily down; there
        seemed to be no shadow anywhere. Locusts hummed loudly. Jerry knew that
        her father and uncle had gone to Hayestown to meet the general. They
        would be back to a late lunch at three. She strolled around to the
        stable.</p>
      <p>Henry, polishing harness, beamed upon her, and wiped his forehead. </p>
      <p>“Git me a fur coat an’ build up the fire,” said he, grinning.</p>
      <p>“Shame on you!” said the colonel, plunging her bared arms deep into the
        trough. “Say, Henry, do you know if my aunt and cousin went with dad and
        Uncle Bob?”</p>
      <p>“Why,” said Henry, with a troubled look, “your aunt and cousin went
        riding! Full an hour ago! Yes, sir, they left about eleven o’clock. They
        says they was going to get back about half-past two.”</p>
      <p>“Idiots!” said the colonel, contemptuously. “Riding! A day like this!
        Where’d they go?”</p>
      <p>“They says they’d go as far as Holly Hill, colonel, and then have their
        meal at the spring, an’ then go right over Baldy, and home!” </p>
      <p>“Crazy! Climbin’ the hill in this heat!” She looked about the clean,
        wide stable. “What horses did you give ’em?”</p>
      <p>Henry looked very uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>“I thought you knew, colonel. I give your aunt Sixpence&#8212;he’s up
        to her weight. But Miss Rose says she was to ride <i>your</i> horse.”
      </p>
      <p>The colonel whirled about, her eyes flashing. “Rose
        said&#8212;<i>my</i> horse! You don’t mean <span
          class='sc'>Baby</span>?”</p>
      <p>“That’s what she <i>says</i>.”</p>
      <p>Jerry turned white.</p>
      <p>“But&#8212;my goodness! Baby’s <i>sick</i>! The vet said she wasn’t to
        be ridden!”</p>
      <p>“I told Miss Rose I didn’t think the horse was up to it,” said Henry,
        aggrievedly. “I <i>says</i> to ask you.”</p>
      <p>“You fool&#8212;you!” said the colonel, blazing. She reached for an old
        cap, and snatched a whip.</p>
      <p>“Give me any horse!” she commanded, pulling down her own saddle. “I’ll
        follow them! They’ll be at the spring. I’ll bring them home through the
        woods.”</p>
      <p>“Why, there you are, colonel! There aint a horse on this place. It was
        so hot yesterday that we turned them all out. They’re two miles away, in
        long meadow. You can’t get a horse on this post.”</p>
      <p>Baffled, the child dropped the saddle. She leaned against the
        door-post, her swimming eyes looking across the baking earth. “It’ll
        kill Baby, Henry,” she whispered, with trembling lips.</p>
      <p>No one was about. Above the Ralston stable some little boys had made a
        fire in the shade. Jerry clinched her hands in agony above her heart.
        Then she picked up her saddle, and went resolutely along the path.</p>
      <p>“Where are you going, colonel, dear?” called Henry.</p>
      <p>She did not answer.</p>
      <p>“Oh&#8212;Baby! Baby!” she was sobbing as she ran; “I can’t let them
        kill you! I’ve <i>got</i> to disobey orders!”</p>
      <p>The carriage, with the three men in it, was met by the news. A mile
        from the post a little boy shouted that the Ralston stable, with the
        wonderful mare inside, was burned to the ground. The old general,
        bouncing out uncomfortably, kept up a running fire of sympathetic
        ejaculation. The major, urging on the big grays, freely used his
        strongest language. But his brother did not speak.</p>
      <p>Sweating, dust-covered, panting, the horses tore past Officers’ Row,
        and stopped at the ruins of what had been the stable. A few fallen beams
        still smoked sullenly, the sickening odor of wet wood filled the air. A
        group of men and boys in their shirt-sleeves stood near. At the sound of
        the wheels, Baron, his face streaked with soot and perspiration, came
        toward them. “I was off duty, sir!” he said, hoarsely. “I was getting my
        dinner. We done all we could! We had the hose here in ten minutes, but
        the fire was too big.” </p>
      <p>His master nodded. After a moment he asked: “She was loose?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir. She must have suffocated. She didn’t struggle&#8212;&#8212;”
      </p>
      <p>“No? Well, I’m glad&#8212;of that.” Her owner walked about the ruins.
        The other men were silent. Finally the major said: “I can’t tell you,
        old man, how sorry I am!”</p>
      <p>“Well, no help for it, Jim. I know you are! Go clean up, Baron, then
        come talk to me. Shall we go up to the house?”</p>
      <p>On the way, he said, sombrely: “I wouldn’t have taken any money for
        that mare!”</p>
      <p>Just at this moment the mare came into the yard, with the weary little
        colonel astride her. The Lady was tired, her satin flanks were flecked
        with white, but she knew her master, and whinnied as she came up to him.
        At the sound, he turned as if shot, and a moment later a shout from both
        men cut short the colonel’s stammered remarks. Her father lifted her
        down.</p>
      <p>“It takes the colonel, every time!” said he. “What lucky star made
        you&#8212;this particular afternoon!&#8212;well, she’s saved your horse
        for you, Bob.”</p>
      <p>“We’ll have to promote you,” said the general, to whom the tired child
        was clinging.</p>
      <p>Her uncle, turning for the first time from the horse, spoke, solemnly:
        “You saved her, didn’t you? I won’t forget this! You’ll have the finest
        Spanish saddle that can be made, for this!”</p>
      <p>“You can go right on breaking rules at this rate!” said her father, his
        arm about her. “And now run up and get dressed. You can tell us about it
        later.” </p>
      <p>“I’ll go up, too,” said the general.</p>
      <p>“Go right ahead, sir. We’ll go to the stable for a few minutes and make
        fresh arrangements for The Lady.”</p>
      <hr class='tb' />
      <p>When they at last went out to the long-delayed dinner, the high back
        chair at the foot of the table found no occupant.</p>
      <p>“Late, as usual,” said the major. “Lena,” he added, “go and tell the
        colonel that dinner is ready.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, if you please, major, she’s gone to bed. She come upstairs more
        than an hour ago. She took her bath, sir, and went right to bed. I ast
        her did she feel sick, and she says no, but that them was your orders.
        She wouldn’t let Nora bring her up no tea.” Lena looked reproachful.</p>
      <p>“And she cried awfully,” said Rose.</p>
      <p>“She never let a tear out of her until I shut the door, Miss Rose,”
        said Lena, firmly; “and she ast me to put out a dress with a plain
        sleeve for to-morrow. She shut the windows down so’s she shouldn’t hear
        the band, but she never cried none.”</p>
      <p>The aid winced. The general cleared his throat.</p>
      <p>“Well, she’s your child, Fitzgerald. But I think I’ll issue a few
        orders in this matter myself.”</p>
      <p>“You’re my superior officer, sir,” said the major, eagerly.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Some weeks after the story, “Ten Thousand Years in Ice,” on page 127,
        was printed in the <i>Argonaut</i>, there arrived at the editorial rooms
        one morning quite a large bundle of letters bearing Hungarian
        postage-stamps. On opening them, we found them to be in various
        languages. One of them was in very queer English; this we reproduce
        verbatim:</p>

        <span class='sc'>To the Editor of the Argonaut, San Francisko</span>:
        Before a short time I red an article from Dr. Milne translating in the
        <i>Pester Lloyd</i> newspaper which was very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>The editor of this newspaper told me that this essay was formerly
        edited by you, an I am so free to ask you:</p>
      <p>Is it very what Dr. Millene wrote from the “Men which is frozen 10,000
        years ago in the ice,” and beg to accept my salutations. I am thankful.

      <p>The next letter showed that his Austro-Hungarian majesty’s officers
        have literary taste. It read thus:</p>

        <span class='sc'>To the Editor of the “Argonaute,” periodical, San

        had the pleasure to read the article: “Ten thousand years in the ice,”
        by Sir Robert Duncan Milne (which appeared in the <i>Argonaut</i> of
        January 14th), in the <i>Pester Lloyd</i>, and in answer to a question
        regarding this article, the editor of the <i>Pester Lloyd</i> advised me
        to write to you, sir, as you would be surely able to answer the
        following question:
      </p>
      <p>Is the article: “Ten thousand years in the ice,” based on mere fiction,
        or is he partially true? I am rather inclined to think that there is
        some truth in the article, because Sir Robert Duncan Milne in speaking
        of himself and his friend calls him by his real name. </p>
      <p>You would very much oblige me, by being so good as to answer my
        question, or in case that you should neither be able to do this, by
        forwarding my letter to Sir Robert Duncan Milne.</p>
      <p>Apologizing for the trouble I may give you by this request, I am sir,

      <p>The next letter was in German. It bore a lithographed heading showing
        that the writer dated it from a large foundry. The letter ran:</p>

        ice.”
      </p>
      <p>If the honored editorial department does not consider it troublesome, I
        would allow myself a question, the kind answer to which I beg, what

        the English original, “Sir Robert Duncan Milne,” he who alone could give
        a definite answer as to what is true in this story; and since the
        original of this most interesting story has been published in the
        journal <i>Argonaut</i>, therefore, I hope that the honored Editorial
        Department will certainly be willing to send to Sir Milne the
        above-mentioned inquiry, so that, if possible, something more about the
        particulars of it may be learned.

      <p>
        <span class='sc'>Esteemed Editorial Department</span>&#8212;In the
        <i>Pester Lloyd</i>, a paper appearing in Budapest, was reproduced under
        the title “Ten Thousand Years in Ice,” a highly interesting story, which
        was published in your very valued paper <i>in the number of the 14th of
          January</i>.
      </p>
      <p>The author of the English original published in the <i>Argonaut</i> is
        <i>Sir Robert Duncan Milne</i>.</p>
      <p>The above-mentioned story stirred up a great and general interest here,
        so that very many readers turned to the editorial department of the
        <i>Pester Lloyd</i> with the question, how much of the story was true?
        Said editorial department not being able to answer the question,
        referred the inquiries to the esteemed editorial department of the
        <i>Argonaut</i>.</p>
      <p>I permit myself, therefore, to make to your esteemed editorial
        department the humble request, and indeed in my own, as well as in the
        name of several friends, to be so kind as to state what was true in the
        above-mentioned story?</p>
      <p>At the same time I request that you may make known to me the
        subscription price of your valued paper.</p>
      <p>Since I can not furnish myself with postage stamps of the United States
        in Budapest, I request that you send me your kind answer without
        prepaying same.</p>
      <p>Recommending my request to your favor, I sign</p>
      <p class='tar mb07'>Most respectfully, <span class='sc'>Dr. Samuel
          Rusznyak</span>.</p>
      <p>After a lapse of a few days we received another batch of letters, two
        of which explained the epistolary avalanche. One of them was from the
        editor of the <i>Pester Lloyd</i>, stating that he had printed a
        translation of the story in his journal and had been overwhelmed with
        inquiries as to whether it was fact or fiction. Another letter was from
        Mme. Fanny Steinitz, a literary lady living in Buda-Pesth, who confessed
        that she was the cause of the outburst, as she had translated the story.
        In order to heighten the interest she had elevated the writer, Mr.
        Milne, to the order of knighthood by giving him an accolade with her
        pen. </p>
      <p>How naïve and ingenuous must be the Hungarian nature! Fancy a number of
        serious American business men writing to an American journal concerning
        an exciting story like that of Mr. Milne.</p>
